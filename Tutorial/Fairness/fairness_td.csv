ftd1,"From what I've seen with editors other than Eric, the elephant in the room is the issue of baiting/poking the bear/whatever the hell you want to call passive/aggressive baiting. No one wants to touch that one, even though it's uncivil as hell and appears to be the tactic of choice whenever someone wants to get rid of someone or get their way. That's the part that saddens me. darkness",toxicity detection,
ftd2,"There are two important features of Smith's concept of the """"invisible hand"""". First, Smith was not advocating a social policy (that people should act in their own self interest), but rather was describing an observed economic reality (that people do act in their own interest). Second, Smith was not claiming that all self-interest has beneficial effects on the community. He did not argue that self-interest is always good; he merely argued against the view that self-interest is necessarily bad. It is worth noting that, upon his death, Smith left much of his personal wealth to charity. Good! Let's all make sure we put forth the idea that Adam Smith was a socialist. That's the wikipedia way!""",toxicity detection,
ftd3,"SORRY PUCK BUT NO ONE EVER SAID DICK WAS NUMBER ONE!! But he is clearly listed as being """"second only to Batman"""" and a """"master detective and martial artist"""" and been trained in all the mentioned combat discplines. No need to mention in skills/abilities about the battles he's lost and won because thats not what an encylopia is supposed to do. Also, what your problem is your going by low end showings and not HIGH end showings where he's proven more than a match for a meta like Slade and pinned Shiva down in one of his earliest appearences.",toxicity detection,

ftd5,"PD: I just have seen that apart from the article Coat of arms of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, there is also a different article named Coat of arms of Western Sahara. That shows clearly that some users here have politically-driven intentions and bad faith, although they claim to be neutral. If they were neutral, logically they would work on the """"Coat of arms of Western Sahara"""" article, intead of trying to merge the two articles and messing it.",toxicity detection,
