ts1,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the arrival of a boat carrying several asylum seekers to Western Australia's far north coast is ""unfortunate"" but not a failure of Operation Sovereign Borders. The federal opposition has gone on the offensive over the arrival of 39 men who say they travelled by boat from Indonesia to remote communities in WA's north-west on Friday It accuses the government of short-changing the department and allowing surveillance operations to fail. Speaking on Perth radio this morning, Mr Albanese rubbished those suggestions, saying the government had not cut funding to the Australian Border Force (ABF) and had maintained offshore processing programs. ""It is working. That's why they're in Nauru. That's the whole point, the whole point,"" Mr Albanese told the Australian Radio Network. ""There's been people wandering around Queensland beaches on the former government's watch. What's important is that the system is in place so that people who arrive as unauthorised arrivals by boat won't be allowed to settle here. ""That's my government's policy."" Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said earlier surveillance was not operating as well as when the Coalition was in government. ""It's clear that they don't have the same surveillance in place that we had when we were in government,"" Mr Dutton said. ""It is inconceivable that a boat of this size carrying 40-plus people could make it to the mainland without there being any detection."" Mr Dutton said it was a ""catastrophic"" failure of border policy that the prime minister first learned of the boat's arrival through the media. ABF's most recent annual report documented a 6 per cent decrease in ""maritime patrol days"" and a 14 per cent decrease in flying hours, compared to the year previous. Senators were told difficulties in recruiting pilots, the age of the ABF's maritime fleet and blowouts in maintenance time frames were the primary drivers behind the reduced surveillance hours. However, the agency also told the Senate Estimates Committee it was mitigating those issues and had sufficient surveillance coverage. The Coalition has accused the government of cutting funding to the Home Affairs department, which the ABF sits under, pointing to smaller spending forecasts in government budget documents. Mr Dutton's claim relates to forecast reductions in appropriations to Home Affairs amounting to $600 million less over four years compared to its most recent annual spend. But when challenged on this point last year, former department boss Mike Pezzullo said actual spending had always been higher than forecasts, and said not only was there no reason to expect this would change, but that it would be inappropriate to describe it as a ""planned reduction"" in spending. Mr Dutton also pointed to the government's abolition of temporary protection visas (TPVs) as a signal that the government was ""weak"" on immigration. The visas were only available to a small cohort of asylum seekers who arrived by boat between August 2012 and the end of 2013, and who were also deemed genuine refugees — a ""legacy caseload"" of about 31,000 people. Refugees on TPVs were moved onto permanent visas last year when the program was abolished, and Mr Dutton said unless the visa class was reinstated the government could not claim Operations Sovereign Borders was operating as it did under the Coalition. Mr Albanese repeated warnings by the head of Operation Sovereign Borders that misleading commentary could serve to encourage people smuggling outfits. ""Are these people on temporary protection visas? No, they are on Nauru,"" he said. ""People who arrive by boat get sent offshore, that is the measure we have in place. ""We have clear positions in place … Peter Dutton will continue to be a cheer squad for things which undermine our borders."" In a statement, Greens senator Nick McKim said the ""political panic"" over the arrival of asylum seekers by boat was harmful to community harmony. ""There is indeed a crisis in immigration — and that is the fact that people exiled to offshore detention 11 years ago have been cut adrift by the major political parties in this country with nary a word from the media,"" Senator McKim said. ""This is the real crisis. Not the arrival of a tiny number of desperate people seeking our help.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/albanese-asylum-seeker-boat-arrival-unfortunate/103483960
ts2,"Four people have been knocked unconscious by a lightning strike at Sydney’s Botanic Gardens. The ambulance service says the group — a teenage male, a woman in her 20s, and a man and woman in their 30s— was standing under a tree when the lightning struck just before 1pm. Paramedics who rushed to the scene treated the two men and two women for burns and cardiac problems. They said they didn't know if the group were directly hit or just the tree. All four were taken to hospitals around Sydney in a stable condition. The teenager and the woman in her 20s were taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, while the other two were taken to St Vincent's in Darlinghurst. Approximately 19,500 homes have lost power in Northern Sydney and the Hunter region in the wake of the storm. Suburbs affected include Balgowlah, Manly, Turramurra, Hornsby, and Berowra in Sydney, and Lake Macquarie. Ausgrid said more outages are expected, but power should be restored within the next few hours. The Bureau of Meteorology has a severe weather warning in place for heavy rainfall, damaging winds, and large hailstones for metropolitan Sydney, parts of the Mid North Coast, Hunter, Illawarra, Central Tablelands, North West Slopes and Plains, Northern Tablelands and Central West Slopes and Plains Forecast Districts. The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) warned the heavy rainfall expected in the next few hours could see parts of the state experience flash flooding. ""There's potential for isolated heavy falls of 50 to 100 millimetres,"" SES Assistant Commissioner Sean Kearns said. The NSW SES has pre-positioned personnel throughout the region, and were well-resourced to respond to any calls for assistance, he said. “I would encourage the public to follow the advice of emergency service personnel on the ground and not to drive through floodwater.” A spokesperson for Sydney Airport is urging travellers to check their flight details as the storm causes delays, cancellations and diversions.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/four-people-struck-by-lightning-in-sydney-during-heavy-storm/103484632
ts3,"Leaked emails show Coles has been profiting from higher prices at the check-out, despite repeated assurances from the supermarket giant that it is doing everything in its power to keep grocery bills down. The emails reveal for the first time the tactics Coles has employed with a supplier seeking a price increase and how it has taken advantage of inflation. It's not alone. An industry insider has told Four Corners that Woolworths has used similar tactics to increase its profits over the last 18 months. Australia has a highly concentrated supermarket sector where Coles and Woolworths control 65 per cent of the grocery market. This cosy duopoly rarely competes on price. ""I would probably say that if you did five shops in Woolworths and five shops in Coles … you'd be a few cents difference maybe depending on the specials,"" Julian Hilliard said. He's spent 38 years in retail, including working for both Coles and Woolworths as a buyer and what's known as a category manager — selecting and purchasing products to be sold in stores. The leaked emails show how supermarkets can exploit this lack of competition to push around suppliers, leading to higher grocery bills. The emails show Coles received a one-off payment from a multinational supplier for allowing a price increase, then passed on this cost to customers. The price increase of around 5 per cent, which the supplier sought to cover its rising costs, was initially dismissed by the Coles buyer based on ""customer needs"" and the ""competitive environment"". Four Corners has chosen not to name the company seeking the price increase or the product involved as the person who leaked the emails fears retribution. Shortly after the price increase was rejected, negotiations began. The Coles buyer said the price increase would cost the supermarket hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that if the supplier wished to proceed, the supermarket would need compensation to close this so-called ""gap"". ""Now this gap is, truthfully, made up. There's no rhyme or logic behind it,"" the source, who works for the multi-national supplier, said. ""When I questioned where this gap came from, they only shared with me an image, not even the actual data."" The supplier was expected to bridge some of this ""gap"". Typically, this involves the supplier accepting a lower margin or making a one-off payment to the supermarket. The emails show the supplier opted for a $25,000 one-off payment, to be put towards online promotions. Just days later the Coles buyer wrote back with good news. The offer had been accepted and the full price increase would go through. ""Thank you for your continued support,"" the Coles buyer wrote. Earlier concerns about the effect such a price increase would have on customers had been quickly forgotten. Watch Four Corners expose the tactics Coles and Woolworths use to drive up profits and the price of your weekly shop, tonight on ABC TV or ABC iview. The source said not only did Coles take the $25,000 in promotion money, but it passed on the full price increase to customers. When asked what this meant for the customer the source said: ""They're the ones that are getting screwed. It just means higher prices at the shelf because the supermarkets are extremely greedy. ""Their main objective with these price increases, regardless of what they're saying to the public, is a margin enhancement exercise. They want to make more money for every price increase that goes through the supermarkets."" Coles chief executive Leah Weckert dismissed the source's claim that this amounted to price gouging. ""You have an email from one supplier, we have over 8,000 suppliers that we work with,"" she said. ""We have a team of people whose job it is to look to validate cost, price increases and we take that job very seriously."" The emails show the supplier was asked by Coles to provide details of how its costs had increased. When it refused this request Coles did not seek any more evidence that the price increase was genuine. Another industry insider told Four Corners that about 18 months ago, Woolworths began trying to increase its own profit margins, using economy-wide inflation as cover. The person, who had direct knowledge of the situation, said Woolworths asked to share in any price increases granted to its suppliers. It would do this by requesting the supplier pay some of this price increase back to Woolworths. That meant consumers ended up paying more, suppliers did not get the full price increase, but Woolworths increased its profit margins. Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci said the company did not employ these tactics. ""When a supplier asks for a price increase, we would like to engage to make sure it's based on true cost increases. And so we are very keen to make sure we don't pass on anything more to our customers than is required,"" he told Four Corners. Woolworths' latest annual report shows that last financial year its pre-tax profit margin from selling groceries rose from 5.3 per cent to 6 per cent. That increase was worth an extra $318 million in profits last year alone. At the same time, its cost of doing business was flat. Mr Banducci denied this was evidence of price gouging. ""There are many things that go and drive the delivery of that result. It's a lot of hardworking productivity and investment,"" he said. ""I've reviewed the supply cost increases, which we'd have to agree in many cases would've been legitimate. ""Between the price on the shelf and the cost increase from the supplier. Those have been in lock step."" Watch Four Corners' investigation into the supermarket sector Super Power tonight on ABC TV or ABC iview.

ts4,"Alys McDonough rubs her face with a wet cloth and then proceeds to wrap her panting dog. ""This is my air conditioning; it's called muslin cloth,"" she exclaims proudly. Her home in Norseman, a boom-and-bust WA town at the edge of the Nullarbor, does not have air conditioning. It's 42 degrees Celsius and the tin roof and windows glisten under the scorching sun. The house is not connected to grid power, and, to get water, Alys has to venture into the backyard. ""It's sort of like camping, only you have a roof over your head,"" she says. Just not a full ceiling. ""We are missing a bit of roof,"" Alys says, pointing upwards. ""But that's OK, we are going to fix it with some cardboard."" She couldn't afford a plumber or an electrician, but, armed with posters, old bed sheets and a sense of humour sharpened by her old comedy producing job, Alys made things work for herself. ""Most people would like to have a ceiling, most people would like to have some aircon, most people would like running water, which I sort of have,"" Alys concedes. But all she says she needs is the sun. When the electrician told her it was not possible to connect the house to power, the Aussie battler did not dismay. ""I just watched about 10 series of Alone before I had this happening,"" Alys explains. ""So I had a bit of context."" She got portable solar panels, power batteries and dehydrated meals. It was not by choice, but Alys embraced the off-grid lifestyle. She says she's ""thrilled"" not to have grid power, and bills. ""Power, not a problem. Money… if I could grow money by pointing a solar panel at the sky, I would love that."" Money has always been a source of stress for Alys, and the reason behind her move from Sydney to outback Western Australia. ""All my money was going on rent, and I just wanted to stop paying rent,"" she says. ""I did an internet search, and I found the cheapest house in Australia, which was this."" With a first home owner grant and $5,000, in 2007, Alys bought her Norseman house for $11,750. She affectionately refers to as ""a bit of a fixer upper"". It might have been one of the cheapest houses at the time, but there are still many vacant properties on the market. The Regional Australia Institute says there are more than 500,000 unoccupied homes in the regions, many in need of updates.  ""There is a real call to update properties and make sure they are at the standard with which they can be utilised,"" chief executive Liz Ritchie says. Another call, that of lower costs, is proving irresistible for people like Alys, who are abandoning capital cities for the regions. That trend is up 12 per cent on pre-pandemic levels and Liz says it's going to hold. ""Citizens are looking for a different way to live, a different way to work; they are looking for new models,"" she says. Alys found hers in outback WA, in Norseman, ""a world of its own"". ""I'm sorted, I have a home, it doesn't matter where it is,"" Alys says. Alys eventually decided to give city life another go and, in 2012, she sold her home and moved to Perth. But, when she had to leave her rental, about a year ago, she faced becoming homeless. Paying more than $500 or $600 a week was not an option. ""Given I had a dog and me and limited funds I thought: 'What can I do?'"" she recounts. ""I thought I'd buy my house back and then I don't have to worry about this worsening real estate situation."" Alys spent all her savings, about $12,500, to buy the house back and there are a few things she doesn't have. But she's glad they include a mortgage, rent, bills, real estate agents and getting yelled at by customers in a job she hates. ""Working a job or two jobs and all that money going on rent and other expenses, it's not good for one's mental health,"" she says. ""When you don't have to worry about all that stuff, there's a lot of pressure that has been lifted."" Struggling to cope with the housing and cost of living crisis, Alys found a solar-powered light at the end of tunnel. She's happy working from home, doing transcribing and selling items online. Only one thing is making her sad: not being able to afford a Netflix subscription to watch RuPaul.

ts5,"Papua New Guinea police have revised the death toll in a massacre in the country's highlands to 26, after revealing they had received the ""wrong head count"". Warning: Some of the details in this story are distressing. Police believe the men were shot dead in an ambush in Enga Province, in a major escalation of tribal fighting in the region. Local police believe it could be the largest massacre in PNG's highlands in recent history. Police had provided a higher death toll earlier this morning, but have since revised that number. Graphic videos and photos have emerged of the bodies of the men loaded onto a police truck. Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary Acting Superintendent George Kakas said officers who responded were ""devastated"". ""This is by far the largest (killing) I've seen in Enga, maybe in all of Highlands as well, in Papua New Guinea,"" he said. ""We're all devastated, we're all mentally stressed out. It's really hard to comprehend."" Facing escalating tribal fighting, Enga Province was put into lockdown for several months last year. Police had been trying to stop the supply of firearms and ammunition into the region, which was supercharging the deadly violence. It is understood this tribal fight involves the same tribes that killed more than 60 people last year. Acting Superintendent Kakas said one of the tribes, along with their allies and mercenaries, were on their way to attack a neighbouring tribe when they were ambushed. ""These tribesmen have been killed all over the countryside, all over the bush,"" he said.  ""Police and defence forces have had to go in to do their best to quell the situation at their own risk.  ""We started collecting bodies, scattered all over the battlefield, the roads, the riverside … and they were loaded onto police trucks and taken to the hospital."" He said authorities were still counting ""those who were shot, injured and ran off into the bushes"" and that more people could have died in the bushes. ""We presume the numbers will go up to 60 or 65,"" he said.  Police have urged for calm in the province.  Enga Governor Peter Ipatas said there was a warning that tribal fighting was about to erupt.   ""[This is] a very, very sad occasion for us in the province and it's a bad thing for the country,""  he said.  ""From a provincial perspective, we knew this fight was going to be on and we [alerted] the security forces last week to make sure they took appropriate action to ensure this didn't occur."" Tribal violence has been rife in the Enga region since the last election in 2022, with another flashpoint occurring last September.  On that occasion, the tribe from another village was blamed for a man's death and then ambushed his funeral, killing five people with bush knives and axes.  In the months that followed, a tit-for-tat retribution spiralled out of control. As more tribes became involved, many villages were raided and burnt down. Mr Ipatas said the province had been trying to manage the fighting, but with 17 tribes involved in the most recent escalation, it was ultimately up to the security forces to keep the peace.  ""It's a very big fight that's not normally in Enga province. This is probably the biggest tribal fight we've ever had,"" he said.  ""The police and security forces must take ownership and be on the ground, assess the situation and take appropriate action. ""Because we know who is fighting, it's not like this is criminal activity that pops up. This is a tribal fight, we know which people are involved."" Police Commissioner David Manning said the proliferation of small weapons in the area has been a concern for police for some time. ""This [massacre] is only made possible through the use of many, many small arms and it is a concern,"" he told the ABC. Commissioner Manning said the priority was to ensure authorities have a structure and strategy to respond to challenges in the area and provide a far more effective command. ""It's unfortunate two of our largest projects that contribute significantly to our economy [are] based in the one region,"" he said. ""These two projects are constantly at risk of waring tribes fighting around the perimeter of these projects."" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said news of the massacre was ""very disturbing"". Australia has already agreed to expand support and training for PNG police under a security agreement signed last year. But Mr Albanese suggested Australia would be willing to provide more immediate assistance if PNG requested it. ""We remain available to provide whatever support we can in a practical way to help our friends in PNG,"" he told ABC Radio in Perth.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/at-least-26-killed-in-massacre-in-png-highlands/103482982
