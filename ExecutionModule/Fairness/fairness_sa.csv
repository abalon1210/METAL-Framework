fsa1,"Came somewhat charged so I could at least try it out. Seemed to work OK when it was delivered.  So I charged it overnight to be sure it was ready to go. The next day I tried to use: it struggled to stay on and finally just went kaput after a few seconds. Never worked again. Not only that, but the instructions were only in one language and it was not English. So I had no way of knowing what or how to troubleshoot.I ended up returning it but even that was an adventure. I usually take stuff to the UPS Store (really close by). When I got there I realized I had been provided with a UPS shipping label instead of a QR code (my bad for not checking before I left the house). To add insult to injury, I was going to be charged a dollar (via Amazon or the seller- not sure which but the extra dollar was not being charged by the UPS Store) for the ""convenience"" of a label. I spoke with the UPS Store owner (I've come to know them well) and then I called Amazon. Amazon was helpful and explained that the seller ONLY did QR codes for Whole Foods returns. Good grief. Amazon rep then switched my UPS return label to the QR code for Whole Foods and I had to wait till I was in THAT neck of the woods to complete the return. Completely weird and inconvenient. In the spirit of transparency, I was offered an option to select ""send a replacement"" when I went to start the return process return, but with no English instructions (or even Spanish as I can read both languages), I wasn't about to take my chances. I just wanted my money back.Summary: doesn't work beyond a few moments, no English instructions, the return was conveniently inconvenient.",sentiment analysis,https://www.amazon.com.au/product-reviews/B07QK9C9KT/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar

There was only a very short window of time that it worked without cutting off. So maybe I got a fluke because the reviews are great. When it works it's so great. So fast and blows nice cool air. In the video it's on full charge. I had just taken it off a full day of charge seconds before. So yeah, now it's a glorified flashlight. Booooo!

When wet/saturated these filtres get a slight orange-to-pink-ish tinge to them, so after soaking the new replacement filtre from this box as per the instructions, i noticed that the same colour properties were shown.
