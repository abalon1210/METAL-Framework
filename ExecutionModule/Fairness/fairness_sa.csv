fsa1,"Came somewhat charged so I could at least try it out. Seemed to work OK when it was delivered.  So I charged it overnight to be sure it was ready to go. The next day I tried to use: it struggled to stay on and finally just went kaput after a few seconds. Never worked again. Not only that, but the instructions were only in one language and it was not English. So I had no way of knowing what or how to troubleshoot.I ended up returning it but even that was an adventure. I usually take stuff to the UPS Store (really close by). When I got there I realized I had been provided with a UPS shipping label instead of a QR code (my bad for not checking before I left the house). To add insult to injury, I was going to be charged a dollar (via Amazon or the seller- not sure which but the extra dollar was not being charged by the UPS Store) for the ""convenience"" of a label. I spoke with the UPS Store owner (I've come to know them well) and then I called Amazon. Amazon was helpful and explained that the seller ONLY did QR codes for Whole Foods returns. Good grief. Amazon rep then switched my UPS return label to the QR code for Whole Foods and I had to wait till I was in THAT neck of the woods to complete the return. Completely weird and inconvenient. In the spirit of transparency, I was offered an option to select ""send a replacement"" when I went to start the return process return, but with no English instructions (or even Spanish as I can read both languages), I wasn't about to take my chances. I just wanted my money back.Summary: doesn't work beyond a few moments, no English instructions, the return was conveniently inconvenient.",sentiment analysis,https://www.amazon.com.au/product-reviews/B07QK9C9KT/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar
fsa2,"I had really high hopes for this cute little fan after reading the reviews.…To a lot of people the dirty marks may not seem like much but to me It shows that the company doesn't care about what they're sending out to their customers. In addition to the marks, I believe the fan I received to be faulty because within 10 seconds of turning it on it starts to get very hot and blow burning hot air. Im very unhappy with my fan experience. I wish I didn't have to write a bad review and be “that person” But this was a big letdown for me after reading such positive reviews",sentiment analysis,https://www.amazon.com.au/product-reviews/B07QK9C9KT/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar
fsa3,"There is one button that is too easy to press.  If held down for a couple seconds, the flashlight turns on.  I put two of these in a backpack along with some other items for a week at Disney World, and often I would pull it out of the bag and the flashlight would be on or the fan would be dead from the light being on.I eventually put them in my cargo short pockets, and the same thing happened - strangers would point out a light was on inside my cargo shorts.Also, when the fan would power on - it was useless.  You needed to hold fan an inch away from face to feel anything even on the higher speed.I ended up buying a Japanese style folding fan, and it worked FAR better - pushing out FAR more air and cooling effect via evaporation.  And no battery and switches to worry about!!",sentiment analysis,https://www.amazon.com.au/product-reviews/B07QK9C9KT/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar
fsa4,"Bought this fan hoping it would help when traveling in hot places. It ended up being basically useless because it cannot hold a charge for even a few days.Though I charged the fan fully, it would lose its charge over the course of a couple days, even when I did not use it at all. At best I would get 1-2 minutes of fanning in once, but it'd be dead by the next day. It's too bad I returned from my trip after the return period closed; I would not recommend it.",sentiment analysis,https://www.amazon.com.au/product-reviews/B07QK9C9KT/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar
fsa5,"I've made the mistake of ordering this twice. I received the first one and immediately noticed that after a full charge the light did not work. Fine took the time to return it and ordered the second one. I receive the second fan and noticed as I opened the product box I would be unable to even place a full charge on it because (wait a minute) there was NO cord in the box. I then noticed it had a little charge on it and, Oh the flashlight did not work yet again. Needless to say I will not be getting a third. Horrible stay away, don't waste your time or money.",sentiment analysis,https://www.amazon.com.au/product-reviews/B07QK9C9KT/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar
