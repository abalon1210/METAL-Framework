ts1,"It's about as far removed as you can get from a rockstar's lifestyle. But cats, antiques and Japanese artwork were Freddie Mercury's happy place, his private photos have revealed. The snaps — mainly polaroids from the 1980s — were part of the legendary Queen frontman's estate, and have been released publicly for the first time since his death in 1991. His photo albums, which comprise 265 pictures, have shone a more personal light on the rockstar's final years at his London mansion Garden Lodge, and abroad. They're set to be sold, along with more than 1,400 of Mercury's possessions, in a series of auctions beginning on Wednesday. David Macdonald, senior director of Sotheby's in London, curated the sale and described the pictures as ""mythology busting"". ""They're very, very biographical, but perhaps not in the way you might expect,"" he said. ""He's sitting in the kitchen with a cat or, you know, there's a photo of a vase, or friends in the garden chatting. It's a different kind of world."" While some believed Mercury lived a wild party lifestyle, Mr Macdonald said ""at Garden Lodge, he was actually more likely to ask guests 'can you please use a coaster'."" When Mercury died from complications due to AIDS, he left his west London sanctuary and everything in it to his friend and one-time fiancee Mary Austin. Mr Macdonald said he didn't think Mercury would have objected to people seeing the pictures, which include Christmas and birthday celebrations. ""There's something very interesting about polaroids because there's such a transient moment in life,"" he said. ""They've been in the darkness for 30 years, actually longer, and to have them out in the light and to share them with people for this moment is quite special."" Ms Austin, 72, has rarely spoken publicly since Mercury's death. Earlier this year, she said it was ""time to put her affairs in order"" and sell the items. ""The collection takes you deeper within the individual and the man I knew,"" Ms Austin told the BBC. The items to be auctioned represent most of what was in Garden Lodge at the time of Mercury's death, and include paintings, his baby grand piano, and original song lyrics to some of Queens biggest hits. ""So much has already been written and discussed about Freddie Mercury in the past 30 years, but perhaps never before have we had the privilege of coming so close to illuminating his personal world, something only known until now by his nearest and dearest,"" Mr Macdonald said. The auction is expected to generate millions of pounds, with some of the proceeds to be donated to charity. The items, including the photographs, have been on exhibition at Sotheby's London headquarters until today — what would have been Mercury's 77th birthday.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/alan-joyce-standing-down-from-qantas-early/102814516
ts2,"An upper house committee into the prevalence of birth trauma in New South Wales has been described as the ""me too of childbirth"" during its first day of hearings in Sydney. The inquiry received a record 4,000 submissions from the public. Submissions were largely individual testimonies from women who detailed a lack of consent, inadequate pain relief and clinical incompetence. ""[The obstetrician] broke my water as he said we have to have this baby today as he didn't have time tomorrow,"" one woman wrote. ""When the doctor started cutting me I could feel everything,"" another woman wrote of her experience. Another said: ""Zero risks were displayed to me … I was never given the chance to provide informed consent."" The inquiry is examining the prevalence, causes and solutions to rates of birth trauma, which reportedly impact as many as one in three women. University of Western Sydney's Professor Hannah Dahlen co-authored the survey that determined that figure. The study surveyed more than 8,000 Australian women about their birth experiences in 2019, finding that one in 10 reported obstetric violence. The definition and use of the term obstetric violence was disputed among witnesses but is largely taken to refer to preventable harm in maternity care. ""No means no except apparently in childbirth, and it's time to change that,"" Professor Dahlen told the inquiry on Monday. ""This is the 'me too' of childbirth."" The inquiry heard testimony that women are not being given full information about the dangers and complications that can arise during birth, which limits their ability to give informed consent. ""They're meeting the obstetricians for the first time when their legs are in the air,"" Dr Jared Watts, president of the Royal College of Australian College of Practitioners (RANZCOG), said. ""They've never met these people before, they're doing things to them they don't understand and we really need to change this to patient-centre care."" He told the inquiry RANZCOG supports improved antenatal education, but added sharing the information with pregnant women is ""hard"". ""You don't want to scare women, because you wouldn't want to have a child if you knew of every complication that could happen,"" he said. Australasian Birth Trauma Association president Amy Dawes disputed his comments in her testimony. ""RANZCOG said we can't inform women about all the dangers associated with birth, [but] we need to stop infantilising women,"" she said. ""Why aren't we talking about this before women are in the birth suite?"" Dr Bashi Kumar-Hazard is the chair of Human Rights in Childbirth and told the inquiry in extreme cases obstetric violence can push women to self-harm. ""The abuse and mistreatment of pregnant women and people in maternity health facilities is a normalised event and it is embedded in culture and practice,"" she told the committee. ""We've had clients and women who've committed or attempted suicide, we've seen women reject their infants."" Each witness agreed that continuity of care, in which a woman has access to the same medical practitioner through pregnancy and birth, significantly reduces rates of birth trauma and should be expanded. Midwifery group practice is available across the state to some women, but NSW Health representatives testified staffing is proving a barrier to expanding the services. ""We have to target this recruitment issue by targeting our rural and regionals as that's where we're trying to attract people to come,"" Deb Wilcox deputy secretary of Health System Strategy with NSW Health told the inquiry. The Nurses and Midwives Union called for private midwives to be given hospital visiting rights to strengthen the practice in the state, and for childcare to be examined as a possible way to improve midwives' ability to participate in odd working hours. NSW Health also issued an apology to women who have experienced birth trauma. ""We are sorry this has been their experience and NSW health commits to listening and learning,"" Ms Wilcox said. The inquiry is expected to run for several months and will move to Wollongong on Thursday.

ts3,"Jack Swindells was just seven months old, left unsupervised and lying on a mat when he was beaten by a four-year-old child at a Brisbane childcare centre in August 2018. It was Jack's second time attending the centre. ""I was at work and took the call from the daycare – they told me that Jack had been scratched on his head, and it was normal policy for them to call when anything [like that] happens. So I just said, 'OK, no problem',"" said his mother, Angela Swindells. Later that afternoon, when Ms Swindells went to pick up Jack and his four-year-old sister, she was shocked by the extent of Jack's injuries. ""I was furious. He had black eyes, he'd been hit with a wooden jigsaw puzzle piece that had left an imprint on the back of his head, he had bite marks on his arms, scratches all over his face. So that's what I turned up to see after a phone call saying he had a scratch,"" she says. At pick-up, Ms Swindells claims the staff had insisted to her that an educator was in the room when the incident occurred and it had lasted mere seconds. When Ms Swindells complained to the childcare centre on Brisbane's north side, the centre revealed that the infants had been temporarily left alone in a room with older children, unsupervised. The email said: ""The educator supervising at the time is writing a critical reflection and is extremely remorseful that this took place when she went to change a child's nappy, despite having adequate staff for the amount of children, we must be more mindful of when to carry out other tasks. ""No nappy changes will be carried out when the dynamic of children left in the room may cause an issue, unless an educator is present. We will not underestimate what can happen in a short period of time."" The family is now pursuing legal action against the childcare centre. ""When I took my son to the doctor [they] told me that his injuries wouldn't have happened within seconds, it would have been sustained over several minutes,"" Ms Swindells said. Her lawyer Sharntiesha Hogan said their caseload of injuries sustained at childcare centres across Australia was increasing. ""Across the board, we're typically seeing incidents where children are falling from heights. So falling from tables or chairs, incidents where children are falling from play equipment and injuring themselves, and where children being physically attacked by other children,"" Ms Hogan said. ""For example, we have one incident where a child fell from a tree and they've actually broken their back from that. ""And the common factor across all of those incidents really comes back to the lack of supervision."" The latest available data showed that in 2021-22 there were 27,551 confirmed breaches across Australia of the national laws at approved early-childhood education services. It also showed a 10 per cent increase in confirmed breaches over the last five years. The most frequent breaches related to: The Minister for Early Childhood Education, Anne Aly, told 7.30 that the government did not know why that was the case. ""The thing is, we don't know what factors [are] behind those increases,"" Ms Aly said.  ""We know that there are more children in care. We know that there are more early childhood education and care providers, which may well be contributing factors to this. ""But we have asked ACECQA (Australian Children's Education and Care Quality Authority) to review childcare safety standards and look into child safety to ensure that the standards that we have continue to maintain that high quality that parents and families expect of the early childhood education and care providers."" Early childcare educators are currently seeking a 25 per cent increase in wages, and the United Workers Union is lobbying the government hard on the basis that a lift in wages will alleviate the staffing crisis. Ms Aly said the government would be prepared to listen if and when it was called to negotiate. ""The union is currently undertaking a process through the Fair Work Commission, [and] we have made the commitment that if and when the government is called to the table, we will be at the table ... but I don't want to pre-empt that process,"" Ms Aly said. Ms Aly said the government had a range of initiatives that it believed would alleviate the staffing crisis. ""We have a national workforce strategy that we are implementing, [and] we're looking at, what are the actions that we can bring forward?"" she said.  ""At the last budget, we had a $72 million package around professional development in direct response to the conversations and consultations that I had with early childhood educators right across Australia, who told me that access to professional development and paid practicums would greatly increase retention in early childhood education and care."" The union has pointed to the record-high number of ""staff waivers"" now in place across the country as evidence the system is failing. Australia-wide, 17 per cent of long daycare centres now have at least one staffing waiver in place which grants centres an exemption to operate despite its staff not having attained the minimum early childhood education qualifications. Ms Aly argued that staffing waivers were only being granted when it was deemed safe to do so. ""[Waivers] are granted in exceptional circumstances to ensure the continuity of access for children in early childhood education and care, and never if safety is deemed to be compromised, or deemed to be a concern,"" she said. Sarah Gardner is the deputy director of the Early Childhood Education team at the United Workers Union and is scathing of the conditions currently faced by educators in the sector. ""They have been holding together a broken system for a really long time, and perhaps the issues that have been there for so long haven't come to light in the way that they are now when the staffing crisis is just so deep that it can't be ignored anymore,"" she said. Professor Susie Garvis from Griffith University's Institute for Educational Research agreed the safety standards had been compromised in Australian childcare settings due to the staffing shortage. ""It is beyond a crisis. And unless something is done, we will not have an early childhood education system in Australia anymore,"" Professor Garvis said. ""Early childhood educators are one of the worst paid professions, but the work that they do is one of the strongest contributions to society."" Professor Garvis said an over-reliance on staffing waivers and agency staff to fill gaps in early childhood education was having untold impacts on the next generation. ""If [a child] has an attached relationship with a permanent carer, they will go up to that educator, they will tell them if they're feeling sad or happy, they will be able to ask for things communicate and engage in meaningful interactions,"" she said.  ""How is that actually possible with a person who's only temporary in that setting?"" Regulation of child care is a complex web that runs between state and federal agencies. ACECQA governs the system and sets out the compliance standards that each state government needs to ensure are met. The latest figures from ACECQA show that across Australia 10.9 per cent of childcare operators are not meeting the national quality standards. ABC's 7.30 has identified numerous examples of childcare centres around the country not being re-inspected following serious safety incidents. Ms Gardner says safety incidents are a symptom of a system besieged by an inability to retain and attract workers due to the sector's low wages. ""Educators do whatever they can to keep children safe, they do whatever they can to meet the legal minimum ratios that they have to. But sometimes it's just mathematically impossible for them to do that at the moment,"" Ms Gardner says. ""They are working more overtime than ever before, they are forced to come into work when they're sick, they might call in sick and the director begs them to come in because they can't find the staff and there isn't the support for the service to do what's actually best for the child, which is to say to the parents, 'I'm sorry, you can't bring your child in – we don't have enough staff to meet the legal minimum ratios.' ""And so people are expected in some cases to cut corners, and that's where the risks of children's wellbeing and their safety can come into play.""

ts5,"Desperate bank customers in financial hardship were ignored by Westpac when they asked for help, according to a new lawsuit. The corporate watchdog ASIC is suing the big four bank in the Federal Court, alleging it breached credit laws by failing to respond to hundreds of people in the legally required time frame. If proven Westpac, Australia's second-largest lender, could face fines in the millions of dollars. ASIC said the customers were struggling financially and unable to meet their repayments because they had serious medical conditions, were caring for family or unable to work. Others were flood victims, recently divorced, or had deaths in the family. Some of the affected customers are quoted in court documents, including a single mother of two children who receives Centrelink benefits. She said she was experiencing domestic violence and added: ""I am unable to work as I have had my finger nearly amputated … on my right hand, this led to two surgeries, second due to infection … Several other factors, has put me in financial hardship. I am currently unable to meet other costs of living."" Another said they were caring for a seriously ill child. ""For the past 2 years my daughter has been suffering with an illness which has resulted in 2 brain surgeries and 2 spinal surgeries and numerous procedures in a hospital 2 hours from home which has caused great strain on my finances."" Some faced serious consequences while they were waiting for Westpac to respond, including being chased for debt collection, ASIC said.  Court documents state at least six customers had vehicles and property seized after submitting their application. Do you know more about this story? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au The legal action comes as increasing numbers of Australians struggle with mortgage stress. ""Submitting a hardship notice, which results in a change to the credit contract, can be a lifeline for people experiencing challenging financial circumstances,"" ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said. ""ASIC has taken this action to highlight the importance of lenders responding to hardship notices within the required time frame to reduce harm to their customers. ""Westpac's failures to respond to these notices compounded their customers' difficult financial circumstances."" According to the lawsuit, Westpac had a serious problem with its online lodging system between 2015 and 2022. This meant hardship notices submitted by almost 450 people were not sent to a customer assistance team. For more than half of them, 229 customers did not receive a response within 21 days, as required. Over 30 times Westpac then declined hardship applications because the bank claimed customers did not provide enough information to support the application, when ASIC alleges that was not the case. Last month, Westpac posted a net profit of $1.8 billion in the third quarter. In a statement, Westpac said it was considering the matters raised by ASIC and has apologised for the ""technology failure"" which meant it failed the customers. ""This error meant we didn't provide some of our customers with the help they needed. For this, we are deeply sorry,"" Westpac Group chief information officer Scott Collary said. ""While we have assisted some of these customers in subsequent contact, it is not good enough that we missed their initial attempt to get in touch."" The corporate regulator is alleging Westpac failed to investigate and fix the systemic issues in its online hardship process. Banks and other lenders have set obligations under the National Credit Code and the National Credit Act when a customer says they are in financial hardship which requires them to respond within a set time frame and to do so, ""efficiently, honestly and fairly"". It is common when a customer is struggling financially that the bank will agree to allow them to change their repayments and negotiate a payment plan. Stephanie Tonkin, the chief executive of advocacy organisation the Consumer Action Law Centre, welcomed the legal action. She said hardship requests needed to be treated seriously because of the dire consequences customers could face. ""When people reach out for help to their bank it's often when they are [at their] most vulnerable, and lenders need to respond swiftly and before things unravel— that's why there is a 21-day time frame for banks to respond to hardship requests,"" she said. ""We hear from callers to our helplines who have been pushed into poverty, with all its devastating impacts, because they haven't received the hardship response they need."" Westpac said it had taken steps to assist affected customers. ""Since we uncovered this issue, we've contacted these customers and completed a remediation program including refunds of fees and interest, debt waivers and payments for non-financial loss, totalling approximately $900,000,"" Mr Collary said. ""We have strengthened our processes and are upgrading our online hardship applications."" Westpac added that between 2015 and 2022 it had received 630,000 applications for hardship assistance. Ms Tonkin said Westpac acknowledging its error was encouraging, but added that ""banks as a sector need to do much more to prioritise help for their customers"". ""This is even more important now in a once-in-a-generation cost of living crisis,"" she said.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/queensland-police-cold-case-murder-francis-foley-2008/102814926
