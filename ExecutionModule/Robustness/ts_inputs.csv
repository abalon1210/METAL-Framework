ts1,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the arrival of a boat carrying several asylum seekers to Western Australia's far north coast is ""unfortunate"" but not a failure of Operation Sovereign Borders. The federal opposition has gone on the offensive over the arrival of 39 men who say they travelled by boat from Indonesia to remote communities in WA's north-west on Friday It accuses the government of short-changing the department and allowing surveillance operations to fail. Speaking on Perth radio this morning, Mr Albanese rubbished those suggestions, saying the government had not cut funding to the Australian Border Force (ABF) and had maintained offshore processing programs. ""It is working. That's why they're in Nauru. That's the whole point, the whole point,"" Mr Albanese told the Australian Radio Network. ""There's been people wandering around Queensland beaches on the former government's watch. What's important is that the system is in place so that people who arrive as unauthorised arrivals by boat won't be allowed to settle here. ""That's my government's policy."" Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said earlier surveillance was not operating as well as when the Coalition was in government. ""It's clear that they don't have the same surveillance in place that we had when we were in government,"" Mr Dutton said. ""It is inconceivable that a boat of this size carrying 40-plus people could make it to the mainland without there being any detection."" Mr Dutton said it was a ""catastrophic"" failure of border policy that the prime minister first learned of the boat's arrival through the media. ABF's most recent annual report documented a 6 per cent decrease in ""maritime patrol days"" and a 14 per cent decrease in flying hours, compared to the year previous. Senators were told difficulties in recruiting pilots, the age of the ABF's maritime fleet and blowouts in maintenance time frames were the primary drivers behind the reduced surveillance hours. However, the agency also told the Senate Estimates Committee it was mitigating those issues and had sufficient surveillance coverage. The Coalition has accused the government of cutting funding to the Home Affairs department, which the ABF sits under, pointing to smaller spending forecasts in government budget documents. Mr Dutton's claim relates to forecast reductions in appropriations to Home Affairs amounting to $600 million less over four years compared to its most recent annual spend. But when challenged on this point last year, former department boss Mike Pezzullo said actual spending had always been higher than forecasts, and said not only was there no reason to expect this would change, but that it would be inappropriate to describe it as a ""planned reduction"" in spending. Mr Dutton also pointed to the government's abolition of temporary protection visas (TPVs) as a signal that the government was ""weak"" on immigration. The visas were only available to a small cohort of asylum seekers who arrived by boat between August 2012 and the end of 2013, and who were also deemed genuine refugees — a ""legacy caseload"" of about 31,000 people. Refugees on TPVs were moved onto permanent visas last year when the program was abolished, and Mr Dutton said unless the visa class was reinstated the government could not claim Operations Sovereign Borders was operating as it did under the Coalition. Mr Albanese repeated warnings by the head of Operation Sovereign Borders that misleading commentary could serve to encourage people smuggling outfits. ""Are these people on temporary protection visas? No, they are on Nauru,"" he said. ""People who arrive by boat get sent offshore, that is the measure we have in place. ""We have clear positions in place … Peter Dutton will continue to be a cheer squad for things which undermine our borders."" In a statement, Greens senator Nick McKim said the ""political panic"" over the arrival of asylum seekers by boat was harmful to community harmony. ""There is indeed a crisis in immigration — and that is the fact that people exiled to offshore detention 11 years ago have been cut adrift by the major political parties in this country with nary a word from the media,"" Senator McKim said. ""This is the real crisis. Not the arrival of a tiny number of desperate people seeking our help.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/albanese-asylum-seeker-boat-arrival-unfortunate/103483960
ts2,"Four people have been knocked unconscious by a lightning strike at Sydney’s Botanic Gardens. The ambulance service says the group — a teenage male, a woman in her 20s, and a man and woman in their 30s— was standing under a tree when the lightning struck just before 1pm. Paramedics who rushed to the scene treated the two men and two women for burns and cardiac problems. They said they didn't know if the group were directly hit or just the tree. All four were taken to hospitals around Sydney in a stable condition. The teenager and the woman in her 20s were taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, while the other two were taken to St Vincent's in Darlinghurst. Approximately 19,500 homes have lost power in Northern Sydney and the Hunter region in the wake of the storm. Suburbs affected include Balgowlah, Manly, Turramurra, Hornsby, and Berowra in Sydney, and Lake Macquarie. Ausgrid said more outages are expected, but power should be restored within the next few hours. The Bureau of Meteorology has a severe weather warning in place for heavy rainfall, damaging winds, and large hailstones for metropolitan Sydney, parts of the Mid North Coast, Hunter, Illawarra, Central Tablelands, North West Slopes and Plains, Northern Tablelands and Central West Slopes and Plains Forecast Districts. The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) warned the heavy rainfall expected in the next few hours could see parts of the state experience flash flooding. ""There's potential for isolated heavy falls of 50 to 100 millimetres,"" SES Assistant Commissioner Sean Kearns said. The NSW SES has pre-positioned personnel throughout the region, and were well-resourced to respond to any calls for assistance, he said. “I would encourage the public to follow the advice of emergency service personnel on the ground and not to drive through floodwater.” A spokesperson for Sydney Airport is urging travellers to check their flight details as the storm causes delays, cancellations and diversions.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/four-people-struck-by-lightning-in-sydney-during-heavy-storm/103484632
ts3,"Leaked emails show Coles has been profiting from higher prices at the check-out, despite repeated assurances from the supermarket giant that it is doing everything in its power to keep grocery bills down. The emails reveal for the first time the tactics Coles has employed with a supplier seeking a price increase and how it has taken advantage of inflation. It's not alone. An industry insider has told Four Corners that Woolworths has used similar tactics to increase its profits over the last 18 months. Australia has a highly concentrated supermarket sector where Coles and Woolworths control 65 per cent of the grocery market. This cosy duopoly rarely competes on price. ""I would probably say that if you did five shops in Woolworths and five shops in Coles … you'd be a few cents difference maybe depending on the specials,"" Julian Hilliard said. He's spent 38 years in retail, including working for both Coles and Woolworths as a buyer and what's known as a category manager — selecting and purchasing products to be sold in stores. The leaked emails show how supermarkets can exploit this lack of competition to push around suppliers, leading to higher grocery bills. The emails show Coles received a one-off payment from a multinational supplier for allowing a price increase, then passed on this cost to customers. The price increase of around 5 per cent, which the supplier sought to cover its rising costs, was initially dismissed by the Coles buyer based on ""customer needs"" and the ""competitive environment"". Four Corners has chosen not to name the company seeking the price increase or the product involved as the person who leaked the emails fears retribution. Shortly after the price increase was rejected, negotiations began. The Coles buyer said the price increase would cost the supermarket hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that if the supplier wished to proceed, the supermarket would need compensation to close this so-called ""gap"". ""Now this gap is, truthfully, made up. There's no rhyme or logic behind it,"" the source, who works for the multi-national supplier, said. ""When I questioned where this gap came from, they only shared with me an image, not even the actual data."" The supplier was expected to bridge some of this ""gap"". Typically, this involves the supplier accepting a lower margin or making a one-off payment to the supermarket. The emails show the supplier opted for a $25,000 one-off payment, to be put towards online promotions. Just days later the Coles buyer wrote back with good news. The offer had been accepted and the full price increase would go through. ""Thank you for your continued support,"" the Coles buyer wrote. Earlier concerns about the effect such a price increase would have on customers had been quickly forgotten. Watch Four Corners expose the tactics Coles and Woolworths use to drive up profits and the price of your weekly shop, tonight on ABC TV or ABC iview. The source said not only did Coles take the $25,000 in promotion money, but it passed on the full price increase to customers. When asked what this meant for the customer the source said: ""They're the ones that are getting screwed. It just means higher prices at the shelf because the supermarkets are extremely greedy. ""Their main objective with these price increases, regardless of what they're saying to the public, is a margin enhancement exercise. They want to make more money for every price increase that goes through the supermarkets."" Coles chief executive Leah Weckert dismissed the source's claim that this amounted to price gouging. ""You have an email from one supplier, we have over 8,000 suppliers that we work with,"" she said. ""We have a team of people whose job it is to look to validate cost, price increases and we take that job very seriously."" The emails show the supplier was asked by Coles to provide details of how its costs had increased. When it refused this request Coles did not seek any more evidence that the price increase was genuine. Another industry insider told Four Corners that about 18 months ago, Woolworths began trying to increase its own profit margins, using economy-wide inflation as cover. The person, who had direct knowledge of the situation, said Woolworths asked to share in any price increases granted to its suppliers. It would do this by requesting the supplier pay some of this price increase back to Woolworths. That meant consumers ended up paying more, suppliers did not get the full price increase, but Woolworths increased its profit margins. Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci said the company did not employ these tactics. ""When a supplier asks for a price increase, we would like to engage to make sure it's based on true cost increases. And so we are very keen to make sure we don't pass on anything more to our customers than is required,"" he told Four Corners. Woolworths' latest annual report shows that last financial year its pre-tax profit margin from selling groceries rose from 5.3 per cent to 6 per cent. That increase was worth an extra $318 million in profits last year alone. At the same time, its cost of doing business was flat. Mr Banducci denied this was evidence of price gouging. ""There are many things that go and drive the delivery of that result. It's a lot of hardworking productivity and investment,"" he said. ""I've reviewed the supply cost increases, which we'd have to agree in many cases would've been legitimate. ""Between the price on the shelf and the cost increase from the supplier. Those have been in lock step."" Watch Four Corners' investigation into the supermarket sector Super Power tonight on ABC TV or ABC iview.

ts4,"Alys McDonough rubs her face with a wet cloth and then proceeds to wrap her panting dog. ""This is my air conditioning; it's called muslin cloth,"" she exclaims proudly. Her home in Norseman, a boom-and-bust WA town at the edge of the Nullarbor, does not have air conditioning. It's 42 degrees Celsius and the tin roof and windows glisten under the scorching sun. The house is not connected to grid power, and, to get water, Alys has to venture into the backyard. ""It's sort of like camping, only you have a roof over your head,"" she says. Just not a full ceiling. ""We are missing a bit of roof,"" Alys says, pointing upwards. ""But that's OK, we are going to fix it with some cardboard."" She couldn't afford a plumber or an electrician, but, armed with posters, old bed sheets and a sense of humour sharpened by her old comedy producing job, Alys made things work for herself. ""Most people would like to have a ceiling, most people would like to have some aircon, most people would like running water, which I sort of have,"" Alys concedes. But all she says she needs is the sun. When the electrician told her it was not possible to connect the house to power, the Aussie battler did not dismay. ""I just watched about 10 series of Alone before I had this happening,"" Alys explains. ""So I had a bit of context."" She got portable solar panels, power batteries and dehydrated meals. It was not by choice, but Alys embraced the off-grid lifestyle. She says she's ""thrilled"" not to have grid power, and bills. ""Power, not a problem. Money… if I could grow money by pointing a solar panel at the sky, I would love that."" Money has always been a source of stress for Alys, and the reason behind her move from Sydney to outback Western Australia. ""All my money was going on rent, and I just wanted to stop paying rent,"" she says. ""I did an internet search, and I found the cheapest house in Australia, which was this."" With a first home owner grant and $5,000, in 2007, Alys bought her Norseman house for $11,750. She affectionately refers to as ""a bit of a fixer upper"". It might have been one of the cheapest houses at the time, but there are still many vacant properties on the market. The Regional Australia Institute says there are more than 500,000 unoccupied homes in the regions, many in need of updates.  ""There is a real call to update properties and make sure they are at the standard with which they can be utilised,"" chief executive Liz Ritchie says. Another call, that of lower costs, is proving irresistible for people like Alys, who are abandoning capital cities for the regions. That trend is up 12 per cent on pre-pandemic levels and Liz says it's going to hold. ""Citizens are looking for a different way to live, a different way to work; they are looking for new models,"" she says. Alys found hers in outback WA, in Norseman, ""a world of its own"". ""I'm sorted, I have a home, it doesn't matter where it is,"" Alys says. Alys eventually decided to give city life another go and, in 2012, she sold her home and moved to Perth. But, when she had to leave her rental, about a year ago, she faced becoming homeless. Paying more than $500 or $600 a week was not an option. ""Given I had a dog and me and limited funds I thought: 'What can I do?'"" she recounts. ""I thought I'd buy my house back and then I don't have to worry about this worsening real estate situation."" Alys spent all her savings, about $12,500, to buy the house back and there are a few things she doesn't have. But she's glad they include a mortgage, rent, bills, real estate agents and getting yelled at by customers in a job she hates. ""Working a job or two jobs and all that money going on rent and other expenses, it's not good for one's mental health,"" she says. ""When you don't have to worry about all that stuff, there's a lot of pressure that has been lifted."" Struggling to cope with the housing and cost of living crisis, Alys found a solar-powered light at the end of tunnel. She's happy working from home, doing transcribing and selling items online. Only one thing is making her sad: not being able to afford a Netflix subscription to watch RuPaul.

ts5,"Papua New Guinea police have revised the death toll in a massacre in the country's highlands to 26, after revealing they had received the ""wrong head count"". Warning: Some of the details in this story are distressing. Police believe the men were shot dead in an ambush in Enga Province, in a major escalation of tribal fighting in the region. Local police believe it could be the largest massacre in PNG's highlands in recent history. Police had provided a higher death toll earlier this morning, but have since revised that number. Graphic videos and photos have emerged of the bodies of the men loaded onto a police truck. Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary Acting Superintendent George Kakas said officers who responded were ""devastated"". ""This is by far the largest (killing) I've seen in Enga, maybe in all of Highlands as well, in Papua New Guinea,"" he said. ""We're all devastated, we're all mentally stressed out. It's really hard to comprehend."" Facing escalating tribal fighting, Enga Province was put into lockdown for several months last year. Police had been trying to stop the supply of firearms and ammunition into the region, which was supercharging the deadly violence. It is understood this tribal fight involves the same tribes that killed more than 60 people last year. Acting Superintendent Kakas said one of the tribes, along with their allies and mercenaries, were on their way to attack a neighbouring tribe when they were ambushed. ""These tribesmen have been killed all over the countryside, all over the bush,"" he said.  ""Police and defence forces have had to go in to do their best to quell the situation at their own risk.  ""We started collecting bodies, scattered all over the battlefield, the roads, the riverside … and they were loaded onto police trucks and taken to the hospital."" He said authorities were still counting ""those who were shot, injured and ran off into the bushes"" and that more people could have died in the bushes. ""We presume the numbers will go up to 60 or 65,"" he said.  Police have urged for calm in the province.  Enga Governor Peter Ipatas said there was a warning that tribal fighting was about to erupt.   ""[This is] a very, very sad occasion for us in the province and it's a bad thing for the country,""  he said.  ""From a provincial perspective, we knew this fight was going to be on and we [alerted] the security forces last week to make sure they took appropriate action to ensure this didn't occur."" Tribal violence has been rife in the Enga region since the last election in 2022, with another flashpoint occurring last September.  On that occasion, the tribe from another village was blamed for a man's death and then ambushed his funeral, killing five people with bush knives and axes.  In the months that followed, a tit-for-tat retribution spiralled out of control. As more tribes became involved, many villages were raided and burnt down. Mr Ipatas said the province had been trying to manage the fighting, but with 17 tribes involved in the most recent escalation, it was ultimately up to the security forces to keep the peace.  ""It's a very big fight that's not normally in Enga province. This is probably the biggest tribal fight we've ever had,"" he said.  ""The police and security forces must take ownership and be on the ground, assess the situation and take appropriate action. ""Because we know who is fighting, it's not like this is criminal activity that pops up. This is a tribal fight, we know which people are involved."" Police Commissioner David Manning said the proliferation of small weapons in the area has been a concern for police for some time. ""This [massacre] is only made possible through the use of many, many small arms and it is a concern,"" he told the ABC. Commissioner Manning said the priority was to ensure authorities have a structure and strategy to respond to challenges in the area and provide a far more effective command. ""It's unfortunate two of our largest projects that contribute significantly to our economy [are] based in the one region,"" he said. ""These two projects are constantly at risk of waring tribes fighting around the perimeter of these projects."" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said news of the massacre was ""very disturbing"". Australia has already agreed to expand support and training for PNG police under a security agreement signed last year. But Mr Albanese suggested Australia would be willing to provide more immediate assistance if PNG requested it. ""We remain available to provide whatever support we can in a practical way to help our friends in PNG,"" he told ABC Radio in Perth.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/at-least-26-killed-in-massacre-in-png-highlands/103482982
ts6,"Before Beagle Bay was thrown into the national spotlight last Friday, the vast majority of Australians would not have heard of the tiny town. When a group of foreign nationals from Pakistan and Bangladesh were found wandering aimlessly in harsh bushland nearby, the community became the subject of national news. Three groups of asylum seekers were found by bewildered locals and authorities rushed up Cape Leveque Road from Broome in response. The men's arrival created quite the stir for Beagle Bay locals used to the quiet life. Beagle Bay, about 150km from Broome, is one of the main communities on the Dampier Peninsula, in Western Australia's Kimberley region. It is 2,151 kilometres from Perth and 2,000km from Darwin, but only 700km from Rote Island in Indonesia, which is a departure point for people smugglers and illegal fishers. With a population of fewer than 400 and limited services or resources, Beagle Bay is a world away from the Sydney Opera House and the images of Australia seen in marketing campaigns. Unlike some of the Kimberley's other Indigenous communities, Beagle Bay is open to visitors. Access to the peninsula has been made easier since the Cape Leveque Road was sealed in 2020 and a small number of tourism operators offer visitors a glimpse of stunning views over turquoise waters. The Sacred Heart Church, with its interior adorned in mother-of-pearl shell, is also an attraction for tourists who flock to the region to escape winter weather. The area is home to the Nyul Nyul people and is a former Catholic mission. Last year, 221 illegal fishing boats were detected in WA waters and the Australian Border Force (ABF) beefed up patrols in the Kimberley Marine Park to deal with the ""unprecedented"" increase. Before the arrival of the ABF and police on Friday afternoon, the asylum seekers' first contact was with residents of the Peninsula's remote communities. Willy Smith, who runs a tourism businesses 60km north of Beagle Bay, drove to Broome to pick up supplies on Friday after he encountered the first group at 9:30am. Dehydrated and disoriented, the men piled into the back of Mr Smith's ute and the stunned resident took them to the church in Beagle Bay. Initially, the group's cover story seemed suspect. ""The story they told me was someone dropped them off in a bus out there and they had a party,"" Mr Smith said. ""They [said] they had a barbecue and the bloke took off and he said he was going to come back in the morning to pick them up. ""Now, with all the attention that's going on, I understand they were dropped off by a boat."" It seems the men thought they would arrive closer to a city — Mr Smith says one mentioned getting a flight to Sydney. Given the scorching summer temperatures and a lack of rain so far in the West Kimberley's wet season, the group faced treacherous conditions. ""They were 10 kilometres away from the actual road — they were like cattle walking out in the bush,"" Mr Smith said. ""Walking out there in the heat, especially in the bush, they could have all died. ""I'm still in shock – we don't see these kind of things – these people just came from nowhere."" The asylum seekers' arrival has sparked a war of words between Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton, but Canberra is a world away for people living on the Dampier Peninsula. Beagle Bay Futures Indigenous Corporation chairperson Henry Augustine said the best thing the community could do as the men came to town was ""just be nice"". ""They were just people needing help I think,"" he said. As the dust settles on Beagle Bay's media storm, one of the enduring images is a local woman hugging some of the men before they were handed over to Border Force – with this small community the unsung heroes of busy few days in Australia's north west.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/beagle-bay-residents-on-asylum-seeker-arrivals-in-wa/103483398

Gold Coast-based company Gilmour Space said it was a month away from the first rehearsal launch in the north Queensland town of Bowen. ""If that goes well then we're ready for launch,"" co-founder and chief executive, Adam Gilmour, said.  ""The only thing we're waiting on is approvals from the Australian Space Agency which we think are coming soon."" The unmanned rocket, named Eris, has been fully assembled with final touches being made to the launch pad and infrastructure. Weighing more than 30 tonnes and measuring 25 metres, the vessel is designed to carry satellites into space. It has been in production since Gilmour's rocket program began in 2015. Mr Gilmour said his team was working towards an official launch in April, making it the first locally made rocket to lift-off from Australian soil. ""It's always tricky with the first rocket in case something goes wrong along the way,"" Mr Gilmour said. ""With our success going into orbit, we will bring Australia into the space age."" The project has been delivered a major boost after raising $55 million from investors including Queensland Investment Corporation and superannuation firms Hostplus and HESTA. Mr Gilmour said the investment would allow his team to make at least four launch attempts, but he expected the first trials might not reach orbit. ""This gives us a buffer with our contracts that we've already got to keep going for at least two years,"" he said. ""Rocket companies around the world spend more than $100 million a year, we've always been very cost conscious here."" Mr Gilmour said nerves were creeping in ahead of the anticipated launch date.

ts8,"""I never thought it'd be that dangerous."" Those were Laith Hanna's words to WorkSafe investigators after he made a fatal, split-second decision that claimed a man's life. On October 21, 2021, Hanna was driving a forklift at his stonemasonry business in Melbourne's north when he attempted to reverse down a slope and lower a large steel rack. Subcontractor Michael Tsahrelias, 25, was standing near the machine and was trying to steady the load when it tipped over and crushed him. Hanna and Mr Tsahrelias's father Steve rushed over to help, but the injured man could not be saved. On Monday, Hanna was convicted and his company ordered to pay a $1.3 million fine imposed by the Supreme Court. Hanna will also pay $120,000 in compensation to Mr Tsahrelias's family and complete two years of unpaid community work. Hanna and his company LH Holding Management Pty Ltd were the first to be charged under Victoria's workplace manslaughter laws. Justice Michael Croucher said the tragic incident was captured on security cameras in the company's warehouse and from across the street. ""It was harrowing footage,"" he said. In the aftermath, Hanna told WorkSafe investigators he had ""no idea"" how the accident had occurred, and had told Mr Tsahrelias to stay clear of the forklift. Hanna conceded he had not followed safety guidelines around operating forklifts on a slope. ""The negligent conduct itself was very brief, occurring over a number of seconds,"" Justice Croucher said. In imposing the penalty, Justice Croucher said Hanna had cooperated with authorities, entered an early guilty plea and showed remorse for what had happened. The judge said Hanna, a father of four, had ""deep feelings of sadness and guilt"", had remained in contact with the victim's family and had paid for Mr Tsahrelias's funeral. Tony Carbone, a lawyer for the Tsahrelias family, said he hoped the sentence would deter other businesses from acting negligently. ""Employers need to stop and think … Don't take any chances,"" he said. ""No penalty is ever going to assist this family with getting on with their lives because they've lost a very important member of their family."" Hanna made no comment as he left court. Victoria's workplace manslaughter laws came into effect in 2020. If a death occurs where workers are placed at a high risk, employers could be liable if their conduct is considered negligent. The laws carry a maximum penalty of 25 years' jail for individuals and fines in excess of $16 million for companies. WorkSafe Victoria director Narelle Beer said the incident was entirely preventable. ""This prosecution is a clear reminder to duty holders of the serious personal and financial consequences they face if they engage in activity that puts the health and safety of workers at risk,"" she said. WorkSafe said companies should ensure effective communication systems were in place between machine operators and other staff. Erecting signs and barriers, and developing a worksite traffic management plans, were among other safety measures the regulator recommended.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/leith-hanna-michael-tsahrelias-forklift-manslaughter-sentence/103483282
ts9,"A 10-year-old Taylor Swift fan remains in a coma days after her older sister was killed in a horrific car accident on their way to the superstar's Melbourne concert. Gold Coast teenager Mieka Pokarier, 16, was killed when the car she was travelling in with her mother and younger sister collided with a semi-trailer outside Dubbo in New South Wales on Thursday. The family had been on an 11-day road trip from the Gold Coast to the Taylor Swift concert at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The girls' mother, Kim Litchfield, sustained minor injuries in the crash and has set up a bedside vigil for her surviving daughter, Freya, at Sydney's Westmead Hospital. The girls' father, Peter Pokarier, has flown from the Gold Coast to be with them. In an online update on Monday, the girls' godmother Karleigh Fox said the 10-year-old remains in intensive care. ""She had brain surgery, they shaved this part of her head, she looks like the most beautiful Viking you've ever seen,"" Ms Litchfield said. Ms Fox said medical staff could not confirm whether Freya had suffered brain damage. ""They did put a drain in also to monitor swelling and there's no confirmed swelling on the brain,"" she said. Ms Fox said the child was getting the best care. ""While she's in this medically induced coma, she's working on healing, she's getting this amazing love and attention medicine and pain relief,"" Ms Fox said. ""She's in the best place possible."" Previously, Ms Fox said the family were still coming to terms with the crash, which happened about 30 kilometres from where the trio had planned to stop on Thursday evening. ""It was an 11-day trip they'd planned, catching up with their friends and Swifties on the way,"" she said. ""We're all having moments of deep distress … and then in other moments it doesn't feel real."" Ms Fox has organised a fundraiser for the devastated family with more than $63,000 already donated. The girls' school, Guardian Angels Primary School at Ashmore, has shared the fundraiser on social media.  ""Thank you to the many GA families who have offered their love, prayers and support to the Pokarier family,"" the school said.  Ms Fox said the family would need plenty of emotional support. ""This will give the family time off work to navigate the shared load of supporting Freya because she's going to need a lot of emotional support processing all of this, let alone all of her physical traumas,"" Ms Fox said. ""Many families are struggling week-to-week without these sorts of complexities."" After learning how many transfusions Freya received from paramedics and hospital staff, Ms Fox also urged anyone who could to donate blood. ""I didn't realise that they could do blood transfusions from the ambulance and we're so grateful that they did,"" she said. ""One unit is one donation so it's really important that people donate."" In her YouTube video on Monday, Ms Fox also shared a message for the girls' mother Kim. ""I don't know many mothers who go to the lengths that you do to keep their kids happy and to help them live their best lives,"" she said. ""You gave Mieka a great life, she was doing a lot of things she enjoyed, I'm sure she really appreciates that now."" She also offered some words of support for the girls' other siblings. ""Kids, we will get through this, I'm really sorry you're going through this, sometimes life is really unfair, and it's no-one's fault, it's just something we've got to go through,"" she said.

ts10,"Swiftmania has hit Sydney. Before Taylor Swift begins her run of shows at Sydney Olympic Park, news of the global superstar's arrival has seen fans brave stormy weather. Following a three-show run in Melbourne over the weekend, where Swift performed to a personal record crowd of 96,000 people, the singer boarded her private jet and made her way north in preparation for four shows in Sydney this coming weekend. Eight-year-old ""Swifite"" Viviene Garrett held onto her pink guitar in the hopes of telling the superstar of their mutual love of music. ""I'm a big fan and I love playing guitar and my favourite song is called Cruel Summer,"" Vivienne said. ""I still really want to see her because my mum tried to get tickets on five devices but she couldn't."" Erika Scaglia wasn't able to get tickets either.  The Italian national has made her way to The Crown hotel in Barangaroo where the star is rumoured to be staying. ""I'm a Taylor Swift fan and I heard she was coming to the Crown,"" Ms Scaglia. ""I tried with the pre-sale and the official sale and I spent about six hours over two days, and it's pretty hard to get a ticket resale without a scam.""  Fans across the country have gone online to try and get their hands on a coveted Sydney ticket. The four shows in Sydney sold out in hours, while many are still on the hunt for a ticket. Fan culture expert from the University of Sydney Georgia Carroll said the fans are pushing the singer but a clever marketing team is capitalising on the hysteria. ""In most cases, fandom is fan-driven rather than industry-driven,"" Dr Carroll said. ""I think Taylor Swift is interesting because it is passion and her marketing is very clever and draws on this kind of cross-engagement. ""Her marketing team will be on social media replying to fans, retweeting fans, engaging with them and the theory is if that happens to you you're more likely to get a reason to meet Taylor."" Dr Carroll said the star ""transcends age and gender"", opening up more sales options. Venue NSW Chief Executive Kerrie Mather told ABC Radio the total economic boost from Swift's shows will be about $135.8 million and will ""be a very significant economic contributor to New South Wales"". While she arrived in Sydney with an entourage, one person was notably absent — her partner and Superbowl winner Travis Kelce.  In a podcast with his brother Jason Kelce, the Kansas Chiefs player said he will likely head down south. ""I'm going to go venture myself over to an island here soon ... the best ones are south at the moment so I'm going to go south.""  ",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/taylor-swift-sydney-arrival-eras-tour/103483550

Despite this, he told his Korumburra Baptist Church congregation last Sunday his faith remained strong. ""Let me encourage you to keep on going,"" Mr Wilkinson said. ""The way is sometimes hard, but God is good. He is with us. ""He promised never to leave or forsake us and I can say that is true."" His nephew's estranged wife, Erin Patterson, was charged in November with their alleged murders and five counts of attempted murder. The attempted murder charges relate to Mr Wilkinson's poisoning and alleged prior attempts by Ms Patterson on her husband Simon Patterson's life. But last week, he delivered his first sermon since the fateful incident as part of celebrations marking 25 years as a pastor. With tears in his eyes, he told his congregation it had been a big week as it marked six months since his loved ones died.  ""At the start of the week it was six months since Heather and Gail and Don went to be with the Lord,"" Mr Wilkinson said. ""Friday was my birthday, turning 70. ""Yesterday was our 45th wedding anniversary, so it's been a pretty big week but I am grateful for all that God has given me, what God has done through me,"" he said in his sermon, published by the Herald Sun.

Mr Burgoyne said he was ""thankful"" that his wife, who was 38 weeks pregnant at the time of the accident, was uninjured. ""Last week I was called by police indicating I would likely be charged in relation to the accident,"" he said.  ""For the first time today I have now been charged with careless driving causing serious harm under the Traffic Act."" The offence carries a maximum penalty of 18 months jail or 40 penalty units, which is a fine of about $7,000. Mr Burgoyne gave a brief statement today during a press conference, but did not take any questions. He added that he had not expected to be charged over the incident. Country Liberal Party leader Lia Finocchiaro said Mr Burgoyne told her about the accident shortly after it took place. NT Police Acting Assistant Commissioner Janell Tonkin said the accident took place on the evening of August 26, along the Stuart Highway and Norris Bell Avenue intersection in Alice Springs. Police allege Mr Burgoyne failed to give way to another car with two passengers. WorkSafe NT said it was investigating the crash, which involved two health workers who were returning to Alice Springs from a remote community. ""Two health care workers were injured in the incident and were treated in Alice Springs Hospital,"" a spokesman said in a statement. ""The occupant and actions of the other vehicle is currently not the focus of NT WorkSafe's enquiry.

ts13,"Landlords would no longer have the right to automatically refuse tenants who have pets if the Tasmanian Liberals win government at next month's election. The existing system has faced criticism from tenants' advocates and welfare organisations because only about 10 per cent of rentals are approved for animals. It means some tenants have been forced to give up their much-loved pets or face the prospect of homelessness if they can't secure approval to live with them. ""Pets are many people's greatest friends and companions,"" Premier Jeremy Rockliff said. ""[This policy] is about ensuring that people do not have to choose between the place they live and the pet they love."" Under the proposed scheme, landlords would not be able to ""unreasonably"" reject a tenant's application on the basis of pet ownership. They could only do so if the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (TasCAT) agreed the animal was a nuisance, causing damage to the property or endangering the safety of neighbours. The Tenants Union of Tasmania welcomed the commitment, saying it would bring the state into line with most jurisdictions. ""We believe that the Liberal policy will strike the right balance,"" the union's principal lawyer Ben Bartl said. ""Tenants will have the right to have a pet, but a landlord will have the opportunity of applying to a decision-making body to argue that there are reasonable grounds for the pet to be refused."" In recent years, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, the ACT and the NT have cracked down on 'no pet' clauses in rental agreements. NSW and Western Australia have also announced they are examining changes. The Tasmanian Greens have previously called for an overhaul to loosen restrictions on pets in rentals, but the reforms, which were bundled up with other measures, did not get support in parliament. The Liberals' election commitment has been criticised by Real Estate Institute of Tasmania, whose chief executive, Michelle Tynan, said the policy lacked enough information. ""Is it appropriate to have a large dog, for example, on the ninth floor of an apartment block in a one-bedroom apartment?"" ""It's those types of nuances that we haven't seen any guidance from the government around other than the landlord would have to go to TasCAT to refuse that."" She said a lack of sufficient consultation had resulted in more questions than answers. ""What's the definition of the pet? Could you have a horse in the backyard of a three-bedroom suburban home if that's your pet?"" Ms Tynan said. Ms Tynan also raised concerns about how landlords would be compensated for potentially expensive damage caused by pets. Mr Rockliff confirmed there would be no requirement for a pet bond, describing the policy as ""fair and reasonable"". The policy has been praised by a young tenant who attended the press conference with the premier. Liam, who did not want his last name used, said he recently had to leave his dog Henry at his mother's place after signing a lease where his pet was not permitted. ""Not being able to have him in the home really does sting a bit,"" Liam said. ""It's great to hear that this scheme will allow us to have the ability to [keep him] when we rent."" The Liberals have also announced several other election commitments designed to increase the number of rental properties on the market. An additional 200 homes would be added to the Private Rental Incentive Scheme, which caps rents at up to 30 per cent below the median rate. Three hundred properties are already part of the scheme, which would be expanded by providing a cash incentive of $200 per week to homeowners who take part. In a separate measure, owners who put new homes on the rental market or switch existing short-stay accommodation to long-term rentals would avoid paying land tax for up to three years. ""We understand that one of [the] challenges is being able to find an affordable rental in a market that has massive demand,"" Mr Rockliff said. ""We're taking action to address the supply side, and while pressure is easing on the rental market we know that more needs to be done."" The Tenants Union said it was a ""good thing"" to focus on supply but described the Liberals' commitments as a ""drop in the ocean"". ""There are about 57,000 rental households across Tasmania, and many of them are in rental stress — that is, paying more than 30 per cent of their income as rent,"" Mr Bartl said. He called for the introduction of rent caps, such as those in Canberra, where rents can only be increased by 10 per cent plus CPI each year. He also urged political parties to consider a moratorium on new permits for short-stay accommodation. ""In our view, there is no point offering incentives to investors to return properties if investors will continue to be allowed to take existing long-term rental properties and turn them into short stay,"" he said. On Sunday the Liberals promised to scrap stamp duty for first home buyers in a plan partially funded by a five per cent levy on short-stay accommodation. Labor is yet to unveil its housing policies during the election campaign. However, it has criticised the government's Private Rental Incentive Scheme, saying some tenants face the prospect of eviction if they can't afford to pay the rent once prices return to market rates. The Greens have called for increased funding to build 10,000 new social and affordable homes by the end of the decade.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/tas-liberals-renters-pets-policy-state-election/103483582
ts14,"If you talk to almost any politician in Canberra at the moment, they will tell you there is something disturbing playing out in their communities. Many are deeply unsettled by it. Anger at a war, unfolding in real-time on social media, is triggering animosity. MPs are detecting a level of polarisation — some call it intolerance — that they haven't observed at this level in their careers. Perhaps even their lives. After last year's polarising Voice referendum vote, Australia went almost immediately into a period of domestic conflict over the war in the Middle East. The tensions have been boiling over relentlessly ever since. There has been a lack of self-analysis from us as a country about what that referendum was, why it failed, and what it tells us about the schisms in our community. The referendum has become like the Voldemort of Australian politics — many of its main protagonists can't talk about it at any depth beyond platitudes. Meanwhile, the world has been thrust into witnessing a brutal conflict that many believe has fundamentally changed community relations in Australia. It is tearing workplaces, families and friendship groups apart. What worries those I've talked to on both sides of the political divide is that social cohesion was already at record lows. Towards the end of last year, the Mapping Social Cohesion Report was released putting the Scanlon-Monash Index of Social Cohesion at its lowest level since the survey began 16 years ago. The index, which provides a barometer of social wellbeing, declined by four points over the 12 months to the end of last year, hitting the lowest result on record. Since November 2020, it has plummeted 13 points. Something is going on and it's sparking many conversations in Canberra. The protracted war in Gaza is having a deep impact on the communities most directly affected. MPs representing some of Australia's most multicultural communities — particularly those with high numbers of Arab and Muslim constituents — say their communities are angry that the Albanese government hasn't gone further in denouncing Israel's military campaign. Their communities are feeling abandoned and ignored. The political ramifications for the Albanese government are yet to be felt but it's fertile ground that could spell trouble. Last week Australia, Canada and New Zealand issued a joint statement warning Israel against carrying out a ""devastating"" and ""catastrophic"" ground offensive on Rafah in southern Gaza, saying: ""There is simply nowhere else for civilians to go."" The statement was strong but it drew criticism from Palestinian activists that it was too little too late. At the same time, Jewish Australians are experiencing the highest rates of anti-Semitism in their lives. I know Jewish Australians who are far from supportive of the Netanyahu government's military strategy but who say they don't feel comfortable in their workplaces or communities because of the conflation between being Jewish and being branded a supporter of the war. Nuance seems dead. A leak of a WhatsApp chat group called ""Jewish Australian creatives and academics"" sent chills through the Jewish community. While members said it was formed as a supportive space, there's no doubt that some conversations focused on rebuking media critiques of Israel. The targeting of individuals is dangerous territory that politicians have vowed to stamp out. The leakers say they acted in the public interest because they claim the chat group was coordinating actions to target pro-Palestinian activists. Some of those on the WhatsApp group say that was not what they were there to do. Others had their names published even though they weren't active in the group. The bigger question is why we are in a situation where Australians — whether Jewish or Palestinian — are being personally targeted and policed. What's the end game? The Australian government has reacted to this episode with a move to criminalise doxxing and introduce jail terms for those responsible. The parameters of the laws will be subject to consultation and public journalism will be protected, but the fact that we are even having this conversation speaks volumes about how toxic things have become. Cabinet minister Bill Shorten told me last week that community and racial cohesion in Australia was at a ""very low point"" since the Israel-Gaza war and he had not seen this level of intolerance during his time in parliament. Speaking on ABC Radio National, Shorten said his electorate office in Moonee Ponds had been targeted several times by advocates. ""It's at a very low point,"" he told me. ""I'm someone who really enjoys mixing with our constituents and getting out and about. The vast bulk of people are excellent, but there's no doubt that we've seen a rise in anti-Semitism, or we've seen a rise in this sort of ugly intolerance which, to be honest, I haven't seen in my time in parliament. ""For those people who would seek to vandalise, so somehow the events elsewhere justify law-breaking here, they're wrong."" The member for Macnamara, Josh Burns, has also been worried about how alienated his Jewish constituents are feeling. ""I know people are distressed about what is happening in the Middle East, but we cannot let the conflict overseas breed division and hatred in our local community,"" he says. He says the majority of the community has been incredible and empathetic, however, there's a ""small and loud group of people who feel that a conflict on the other side of the world is an excuse to target their fellow Australians"".  ""The way we talk about the conflict matters, our words matter, and we must not forget what it means to be a proud multicultural nation — listening, empathising and understanding one another."" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's strategy has been to try to de-escalate the tensions. The government is trying to avoid throwing a match on a tinderbox. At the heart of the growing tensions is a sense of mistrust — at corporations, politicians, a questioning of motivations. Tony Barry, a director at RedBridge, says the emerging and growing problem for corporate, media and political leaders at the moment is that public trust in their institutions is at an all-time low, according to their research. ""Current public assessments are that these institutions are not on their side and in most cases are actively working against their interests because they are not aligned with their values,"" he says. Some political insiders tell me this sentiment about a lack of trust and the cost of living crisis is turbo-charging the tensions in the community. Albanese has been trying to quietly play the role of unifier — he doesn't choose a side in his rhetoric, he denounces anti-Semitism and Islamophobia simultaneously. It's a strategy he has followed for several months now, but as community tensions rise so do frustrations about where this all ends. Will the divisions remain a feature of life and how will we navigate our way out of it?

ts15,"A woman accused of murdering her elderly parents by allegedly injecting them with her own medication has indicated she will fight breach of bail charges against her. Raelene Polymiadis, 63, is accused of murdering her 94-year-old mother and father, with police alleging she did so by administering them with lethal doses of her prescription insulin one year apart. Her mother Brenda Anderson died in 2022 and her father Lynton Anderson died in 2023. On Monday, Ms Polymiadis appeared in the Adelaide Magistrates Court for allegedly breaching her bail conditions on five occasions. She was initially granted bail last year, but was briefly taken back into custody in January after police alleged she was seen ""strolling around"" Ingle Farm Shopping Centre while on home detention. Prosecutors also previously said CCTV showed an unknown woman entering her vehicle outside the shopping centre, with Ms Polymiadis allegedly refusing to disclose her identity. The other alleged breaches included sightings at locations on the Salisbury Highway, including at a temple.  Despite a magistrate previously acknowledging the alleged breaches, Ms Polymiadis was granted bail again due to concerns her diabetes was not being treated properly in custody. Last month, the prosecution asked the court to revoke bail on the murder charges, but the application was dismissed. Today, Magistrate David McLeod adjourned the hearing until after Ms Polymiadis returns to court to answer the murder charges. He asked defence counsel Marie Shaw KC if the breach of bail charges before him were disputed. ""They are, your honour,"" Ms Shaw replied. Ms Polymiadis did not comment outside of court, and her husband, who jostled with media after the last hearing, left the court separately.

ts16,"A man convicted of crashing a stolen car on Sydney Harbour Bridge while under the influence of drugs has escaped a prison sentence.  Christopher Walker, 21, faced the Central District Court in Sydney almost two years after the dramatic incident, which was caught on dashcam.  The then 19-year-old from Queensland stole a Toyota Kluger SUV after assaulting a man in the CBD, then swerved into oncoming traffic and slammed into a van.  The Kluger flipped onto its roof before bursting into flames causing widespread chaos during morning peak hour. Walker had methamphetamine in his system at the time of the accident.  During sentencing, Judge Justin Smith told the court he found Walker's remorse ""truthful and genuine.""  He was convicted and handed an intensive community order of two years and nine months, which will expire in November 2026.  Judge Smith told the court he was mindful of the harm Walker caused Andrew Cheng, who was the driver of the van involved in the crash.  Mr Cheng sustained serious pelvic and leg injuries and has been unable to work since the accident.  ""This was not a lapse of judgement …it was an abandonment of responsibility,"" Judge Smith said.  However, he said he was impressed with Walker's commitment to completing drug rehabilitation after being released on bail.  Walker previously told the court he wants to become a support worker for people struggling with addiction.  Walker's last memory of the day of the crash was walking through the CBD and blacking out beside a building. The court heard he has not used drugs since the day of the accident and has found stable employment after finishing a Certificate IV in Community Service.  During an earlier sentencing hearing, Walker described his time in custody as 'traumatising' and said he developed anxiety and paranoia while detoxing behind bars.  ""I've seen a lot of things that I struggle with,"" he told the NSW District Court.  ""My experience in custody was horrible.""

ts17,"For the first time, All-Star weekend featured a shootout between WNBA and NBA superstars. It was a hotly anticipated showdown between the greatest shooter in NBA history, Stephen Curry, and Sabrina Ionescu, who set the record for the most threes made in a single WNBA season last year. The shootout played out as well as organisers could have hoped, with Ionescu coming out first, knocking down 18 of 27 shots in her 70 seconds for a score of 26, before Curry hit 21 for 29 points, only surpassing Ionescu's score on his penultimate ball. But the moment after Curry's final ball ripped through the twine, the dulcet tones of commentator Kenny Smith sucked some air out of the moment. ""I think she should've shot from the women's line,"" Smith said. Co-commentator Reggie Miller, fourth in terms of threes made in NBA history, told him ""stop it"", but Smith continued. ""She should've shot from the women's line, that would've been a fair contest,"" he said. ""I still root for Sabrina [but] she should've shot from the three-point line that the women shoot from."" ""Why are you putting those boundaries on her,"" Miller asked Smith, who compared it to men's and women's tees in golf. ""Good job, Sabrina. Don't let any man put boundaries on you like Kenny."" Later in the broadcast, as Smith spoke about the potential to get more NBA and WNBA players involved next time, Miller, the brother of WNBA legend Cheryl, mocked him by saying: ""Well according to you, you want her just playing with dolls."" The WNBA line is between half a metre and a metre closer than the NBA line and the initial details released for the shootout had her shooting from closer with a smaller ball. Ionescu used a WNBA-sized ball, which is 2.5cm smaller in circumference, but she ensured she shot from the same distance as Curry. Smith was roundly criticised on social media for his ""condescending"" commentary. WNBA legend Sue Bird said it was a missed opportunity to not have any women on the broadcast. Ionescu's score equalled the highest tally in this year's official NBA shootout, won by Damian Lillard, and she said her performance from NBA distance hopefully changed some people's perceptions. ""Shooting from the NBA line for me is what I wanted to do to show all those young kids to not be scared of going out there and doing something that's never been done before,"" she said. The NBA's league office said the Saturday night All-Star festivities, including Ionescu vs Curry, was its most watched in four years, with 10 million unique viewers. ""To be able to go out there and compete against one another and knowing it was gonna open the eyes of a lot of people watching,"" Ionescu said. ""After it was done we [Ionescu and Curry] were so happy and thrilled with the results and how it went down."" After the inaugural success, there are already talks of potentially including fellow NBA sharp-shooter Lillard and University of Iowa sensation Caitlin Clark, who could join the WNBA next season. Clark last week broke the record for the most points in women's college basketball history. She did it with a three-pointer from about 10.5 metres out.

The 1999 inquiry was told that on the afternoon prior to her disappearance she had been driven to the Red Tomato Inn at Kingsford at 7pm. The next day Ms Balmain's bag, shoes, make-up, diary, credit cards and the keys to her flat were found scattered around several Kingsford streets. That same day, the inquest was told, Ms Balmain was supposed to catch the 9:30am train to Newcastle to meet her mother. On Monday, the matter was back in the Coroners Court, a quarter of a century after the initial inquest. The directions hearing came three years after a $1 million reward was announced for information regarding the disappearance of Ms Balmain. Deputy State Coroner Joan Baptie was told the officer in charge had been asked to give an updated statement ahead of a hearing in April. The court was told there was some outstanding material in the police brief that was expected to be served within a week.

ts20,"Alone, and on the other side of the world, footballer Katrina Gorry walked into a fertility clinic and took her first steps toward having a baby as a single mum. She knew her decision would change her life. What she wasn't banking on was that her baby girl Harper would become her secret weapon, reigniting her love of football, and propelling the midfielder back into the Matildas national team in readiness for the 2023 World Cup on home soil. ""I play for her now,"" says Gorry, 31, who battled an eating disorder and waning enthusiasm for the game in the years before undergoing IVF treatment in 2020. ""For a long time, I was like, 'You know what, I'm done with this',"" Gorry tells Australian Story. ""Then when I had her, it was almost like I was a kid again. ""She definitely reignited that dream."" Nine weeks after Harper's birth Gorry threw herself into training, a renewed fire in her belly. Three months later, she played her first return game for her hometown team, the Brisbane Roar. Then, with six-month-old Harper in her arms, she jetted off to Sweden to begin playing with Vittsjö GKI, a team in that country's top league. There to help Gorry and Harper settle in was Clara Markstedt, a striker on the team. Falling in love was the last thing on Gorry's mind. ""I just wanted to play football, enjoy my time with Harper and completely focus on us,"" she says. But Markstedt quickly became enamoured of the ""confident and calm"" Gorry and bewitched by Harper and before long, the couple moved in together. Now they're engaged, Markstedt is pregnant, and the family has moved to the UK where Gorry is playing in England's top tier Super League with West Ham United, already notching up two Player of the Match gongs. Fearless is the word her Matildas teammates use to describe the style of the pocket rocket they call Mini, who had the highest number of tackles — 59 — of any player in the World Cup. On field or off, it's an apt description. Football and babies. That was ""all that mattered"" to Gorry growing up, according to her mother, Linda Gorry. ""She just always wanted to be a mother,"" Linda says. With four siblings, a half-brother and three stepbrothers in a blended family that celebrates milestones together, Gorry's sense of family was strong. As was her desire to play soccer. Netball held no appeal. Taken to try the traditional girls' game as a six-year-old, Gorry pronounced netball boring. Then proceeded to kick the ball. But when Gorry was let loose on a soccer field, she shone. ""Even with all the boys in the team, she was the one that was targeted,"" Linda says. ""It was pretty obvious, pretty early on that she was really good."" So obvious that at the age of 14, she was selected for the Queensland Academy of Sport. It didn't work out, her immaturity a barrier to the commitment required, and her scholarship was rescinded. ""You just don't know what you want until it's been taken away,"" Gorry says. ""From that moment on, I knew I wanted to be a footballer."" She was accepted back into the academy the next year, and at 16, Gorry began the travelling life of a footballer. Stints with Melbourne Victory, Adelaide United and Canada's Ottawa Fury followed and in 2012, as a 19-year-old, Gorry made her debut for Australia against the then world champions Japan. She gets emotional now thinking about it. ""Putting on the Australian jersey, singing the national anthem and yeah, just living out a dream,"" she says, her voice quavering. ""You still feel that same feeling every time you step out in the field for the national team. You never take it for granted."" But the Matildas started to feel they were being taken for granted. The national women's team was paid below the minimum wage, forced to squeeze other jobs into training and travelling to make ends meet. Their pay and conditions when travelling were nothing like that of the men's team. It was time to take a stand. After a strong showing at the 2015 World Cup – Gorry's first – the team went on strike, missing a US tour. Two months later, they signed a landmark deal. It was a difficult time, says Gorry, but critically important to creating the crowd-wowing Matildas of today. ""It's something we still speak about now,"" she says. ""From that day forward, things have changed dramatically for the national team."" That team bond was on full show in early 2016 when the Matildas knocked the qualifying matches for the Rio Olympics out of the park, winning all five games in an arduous 10-day stint. ""The feeling we had at that time was just like, 'It doesn't matter who's playing, we're the best and we're going to win'."" Come Rio, the Matildas made the quarterfinals — against the football-mad host country, Brazil.  The packed stadium witnessed a thrilling match that went to a penalty shootout. It was neck and neck when Gorry stepped up. She could win the game. But she missed, with Alanna Kennedy the next Matilda up.  She missed. It was all over. Missing her shot hit Gorry hard. It was, says Linda, ""a monkey on her back"" for a long time. ""I remember feeling just so defeated,"" Gorry says. ""It's a feeling that I hadn't really felt in football."" Soon after, she was off to Japan to play with Vegalta Sendai, and years of back-to-back seasons, the pleasure and pain of social media scrutiny and being away from home began to take their toll. ""I think social media probably killed us a little bit there for a while,"" she says. ""You get so caught up in what other players look like, what their strengths are and what other people are doing in the world and what they think of you,"" she says. ""I just spiralled into a really hard and dark place."" She started having body image issues and an eating disorder developed. ""We'd have to weigh in before we went to breakfast and, you could hear it across the breakfast table. 'I'm not going to eat breakfast this morning', or 'I'm not eating carbs for lunch' and things like that,"" Gorry says. ""I wouldn't like to look at myself in the mirror,"" she says. ""I would not want to eat. And then I'd kind of binge and then it would just be like a yo-yo effect."" There were days she wouldn't get out of bed. Gorry still managed to make the World Cup team in 2019, despite injuring her ankle in the lead-up. She didn't play much in that tournament but the time off with injury, and being back with the national team, allowed her to take stock. She began to talk about her eating disorder and sought help and after three years, Gorry began to recover. ""It wasn't until I really started to speak out and decided that, you know, I still wanted to be a football player, and I was going to give it one last shot,"" Gorry says. ""And in the middle of COVID, I decided to go to Norway."" Injury struck Gorry again during her Norwegian football campaign. COVID postponed the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. And Gorry would go to bed dreaming of baby names. It was time. Gorry walked into that fertility clinic, confiding in no-one about her plan. Not her parents with whom she is very close, not her friends or teammates. ""I didn't want anyone to talk me out of it,"" she says. With Harper's birth came the rebirth of Gorry. She is, says her mum, a changed human. ""[Harper] was that missing part of Katrina's life,"" Linda says. ""Once Harper came into her life, it was this fulfilment that I've never seen."" Linda has had a front-row seat. When Gorry was recalled to the Matildas in 2022, the question of who would care for Harper when Gorry was on the field was quickly answered by Linda. ""Mum was like, 'Alright, I'm coming with you',"" Gorry says. The family-friendly vibe in the Matildas is a long way from the team's early days, when players had to decide between representing their country or having a baby. Gorry's teammate Tameka Yallop also has a little girl, Harley, and fellow Matilda Charli Grant says the children's presence added a new layer of positive culture to the team. ""If you're having a bad day and you see the kids around, it just makes you smile immediately and also shows there's so much more to life than just football,"" Grant says. ""It really put life into perspective and we're really grateful to have them around. Everyone loved them."" And Australians loved the Matildas, the nation becoming transfixed by the team's campaign for World Cup glory. ""Football in Australia has changed forever,"" says Gorry, beaming as she recalls the crowds and cheers of one of the most successful sporting events in the country's history. Her highlight? The epic penalty shootout against France in the quarterfinal. Some in the crowd would have recalled Gorry's missed kick in the Rio shoot-out but few knew she was grieving the recent death of her partner, Clara's, father. The pressure was immense. But as she lined up to take her kick, Gorry says the presence of Clara's dad, Peter Markstedt, ""just took over"". ""He wasn't going to let me miss,"" she says. She scored and the crowd went wild. The upset of Rio disappeared. ""I had to get the monkey off my back and step up in a major tournament,"" she says. ""I feel like I did that."" The Matildas won that night at the end of the 20-shot tiebreaker but finished fourth in the tournament. It was not the fairytale the Matildas had hoped for, but Gorry has her sights set firmly on the future. Three big occasions are on the horizon. In June, Markstedt is due to give birth, to a baby boy. Six weeks later, barring injury and a major upset, Gorry will run onto a field in France with her Matildas teammates to launch their campaign to take home a medal at the Paris Olympics. ""I think this is going to be our year,"" she says. ""I think we can really do it."" And come 2025, Gorry and Markstedt will get married, their two children by their side. ""I never was interested in getting married,"" Gorry says. ""But after I met Clara, I was like, 'This is my girl. We're going to do life together'.""

ts21,"Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, will meet European foreign ministers in Brussels, the EU's foreign policy chief has said. The 47-year-old Kremlin critic died in an Arctic prison on Friday after spending more than three years behind bars, prompting outrage and condemnation from Western leaders and his supporters. The cause of his death is still unknown, with reports that an autopsy has not been completed and his mother and supporters given conflicting information. ""When Alexei's lawyer and mother arrived at the colony this morning, they were told that the cause of Navalny's death was sudden death syndrome,"" Ivan Zhdanov, who directs Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, said on Saturday. ""Sudden death syndrome"" is a vague term for different cardiac syndromes that cause sudden cardiac arrest and death. Ms Navalnaya would be welcomed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, Josep Borrell said late on Sunday on X, formerly Twitter. ""EU Ministers will send a strong message of support to freedom fighters in Russia"" and ""honour"" Mr Navalny's memory, he said. Ms Navalnaya, who had not seen her husband in two years, had said she held Russian President Vladimir Putin personally responsible and called on the international community to ""unite and defeat this evil, terrifying regime"". Italy's Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Ms Navalnaya's ""words will help all of us Europeans to understand even better what kind of violent system we have to confront and contain in Ukraine"". ""It will make us feel the threat that weighs on Russian citizens and on every region of our Europe, a continent to which violence, brutality, and war have been shamefully and irresponsibly returned,"" Mr Tajani said in a statement. Mr Navalny was Russia's most prominent opposition leader and garnered a huge following as he campaigned against corruption under Mr Putin. Ms Navalnaya had stood by her husband as he galvanised mass protests in Russia, flying him out of the country as he lay in a coma after a poisoning and returning to Moscow with him. She had since clung on to the hope that she would see him again even as he was given 19 years in prison. After his death was announced, Ms Navalnaya posted a photo on Instagram with the caption ""I love you"" in Russian. Mr Navalny's last post on Telegram before he died was a Valentine's message for his wife. ""Babe, you and I have everything like in the song: cities between us, airfield take-off lights, blue blizzards and thousands of kilometres. But I feel that you are there every second, and I love you more and more."" Mr Putin — who famously never referred to Mr Navalny by name -- was on a visit to the Urals on Friday and made no mention of the death. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, accused Western leaders on Friday of ""absolutely unacceptable"" and ""hysterical"" reactions to Mr Navalny's death. World leaders and observers are attributing blame for Mr Navalny's death to Mr Putin. ""You knew it could happen at any time,"" the Atlantic Council's Brian Whitmore told ABC NewsRadio, pointing to the alleged 2020 poisoning with nerve agent Novichok. ""They tried to kill him one time, so I'm not really surprised they tried again and this time, succeeded."" Mr Whitmore also said he did not think it mattered whether Mr Navalny had died as a result of conditions in the penal colony, or direct assassination. ""Putin killed Navalny … Navalny didn't die, Putin killed him. He put him in that prison on trumped-up charges after trying to poison him. ""It's just the latest in a series of opponents of Putin who've met the same fate."" Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service reported that Mr Navalny felt sick after a walk on Friday and became unconscious at the penal colony in the town of Kharp, in the Yamalo-Nenets region about 1,900 kilometres north-east of Moscow. An ambulance arrived, but he could not be revived, the service said, adding that the cause of death was still ""being established"". A few hours after the announcement, Ms Navalnaya said she did not know whether or not to believe the news due to what she said were the lies of Russia. But on Saturday, Mr Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh confirmed that he was dead. His 69-year-old mother, Lyudmila, had been given a notice of the death, Ms Yarmysh said. The time of death in that notice was 2:17pm local time on February 16, Ms Yarmysh said. Mr Navalny had been jailed since January 2021, when he returned to Moscow after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. He received three prison terms since his arrest, on a number of charges he has rejected as politically motivated. After the last verdict that handed him a 19-year term, Mr Navalny said he understood he was ""serving a life sentence, which is measured by the length of my life or the length of life of this regime"". The news of Mr Navalny's death came a month before a presidential election in Russia that is widely expected to give Putin another six years in power. ""Elections in Russia are rituals,"" Mr Whismore said. ""I think they were worried that Navalny was going to spoil the ritual."" On Monday, Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen released a joint statement expressing outrage at Mr Navalny's death and calling for those responsible to be held to account.  On Sunday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese US President Joe Biden and other world leaders in holding Mr Putin accountable. ""This has been an appalling atrocity,"" he said. ""This is a brave man who stood up for democratic values and human rights in Russia in his country. ""His treatment is just beyond the pale and we hold Vladimir Putin responsible for that."" Foreign Minister Penny Wong has told her department to call in Russia's Ambassador to Australia to outline the government's serious concerns over the death of Alexei Navalny. Questions about the cause of death lingered, and it remained unclear when the authorities would release Navalny's body. More than 29,000 people have submitted requests to the Russian government asking for the politician's remains to be handed over to his relatives, OVD-Info said Sunday. Mr Navalny's team said on Saturday that the politician was ""murdered"" and accused the authorities of deliberately stalling the release of the body. Mr Navalny's mother and lawyers received contradictory information from various institutions they visited in their quest to retrieve the body. ""Everything there is covered with cameras in the colony. Every step he took was filmed from all angles all these years. Each employee has a video recorder. In two days, there has been not a single video leaked or published. There is no room for uncertainty here,"" Mr Navalny's closest ally and strategist, Leonid Volkov, said on Sunday. An unidentified source told state-controlled RT that Mr Navalny died from a blood clot. A paramedic from the local Salekhard ambulance service told independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta that he had heard Mr Navalny's torso showed bruising consistent with being held down during convulsions, and with external cardiac compressions. More than 300 people have been detained at events across 39 Russian cities since Mr Navalny's death, rights group OVD-Info said on Sunday. People streamed to ad-hoc memorials and monuments to victims of political repression with flowers and candles on Friday and Saturday to pay tribute to the politician. In 39 cities, police detained 366 people by Sunday evening, according to OVD-Info, which tracks political arrests and provides legal aid. Earlier in the weekend, the group reported 401 detentions in two days, but later updated the number and said that their count ""may change both up and down over the next few days"" as information was verified. More than 200 arrests were made in St Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, the group said. By Sunday evening, court officials in St Petersburg reported rulings ordering 154 of those detained to serve from one to 14 days in jail. Among those detained there was Grigory Mikhnov-Voitenko, a priest of the Apostolic Orthodox Church — a religious group independent of the Russian Orthodox Church — who announced plans on social media to hold a memorial service for Mr Navalny and was arrested on Saturday morning outside his home. He was charged with organising a rally and placed in a holding cell in a police precinct, but was later hospitalised with a stroke, OVD-Info reported. On Sunday, US ambassador Lynne Tracy and the UK's Nigel Casey were pictured paying their respects at the Solovetsky Stone in Moscow — a monument to political repression. Memorial events also took place in cities across the world. In Melbourne, a memorial was set up on Princes Bridge. In Berlin, members of the Russian activist group Pussy Riot held a demonstration outside the Russian Embassy, holding banners that read ""murderers"" in English and Russian. The group, which included Pussy Riot members Nadya Tolokonnikova and Lusya Shtein, as well as longtime Navalny ally Lyubov Sobol and former Russian state media journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, planned to march with the banner to the city's Brandenburg Gate but were ultimately stopped by police. Ms Tolokonnikova told The Associated Press after the demonstration that such actions were meant to show ""that we exist"". ""We show ourselves to each other and support each other, and show with this action that Russia still has a future, and the idea of a 'beautiful Russia of the future' hasn't died,"" she said, using a term Mr Navalny had famously coined. ""Right now [some are] saying that hope died together with Navalny. But it seems to me that with [the death of] Navalny it wasn't the hope that died, but rather responsibility was born."" Dozens of people in Romania's capital of Bucharest also gathered outside the Russian Embassy on Sunday to pay tribute to the opposition leader. Many lit candles and placed flowers next to a memorial portrait of Mr Navalny, while several people brandished placards that read: ""You don't win free elections by murdering the opposition."" In Finland, a group of Russian residents gathered signatures for a petition proposing a name change for a park adjacent to the Russian embassy in the capital, Helsinki, to Navalny Park. Other tributes were laid outside the Russian embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark and the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France.

ts22,"Departing great David Warner has called for a renewal of the trans-Tasman rivalry after a drought of Australian teams touring New Zealand. The nations' Twenty20 sides will face off for the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy this week, beginning in Wellington on Wednesday before two matches at Auckland's Eden Park. The clashes will be Warner's last bilateral series for Australia. The 37-year-old will finish his international career at June's T20 World Cup in the USA and the Caribbean but keep playing short-form cricket in various domestic leagues. For the Kiwis, the upcoming series presents the last chance to barrack against one of their chief antagonists. Warner was subject to vile sledging that included attacks on his family on a 2016 visit — and that was before the sandpapergate scandal which cemented his reputation among rival fans. ""They got personal,"" the opener said in Wellington on Monday. ""If they have to get personal, that's their character. I just go about my business. That's upon each individual. ""If you want to pay your money to come and abuse people then you know, you have to go back and lay in your own bed. ""We get to play the game of cricket that we love."" Modern venues are a far cry from Warner's first taste of Kiwi cricket, back in 2010. Warner — who had broken into the Australia side a year earlier — flew in for a couple of matches in the NZ domestic competition with the pink-clad Northern Knights. His first outing came at Oamaru, a South Island town of 14,000 people best known as the hometown of All Blacks captain Ritchie McCaw, but otherwise usually passed through on the drive between Christchurch and Dunedin. ""I literally thought it was a ghost town. I was walking down the street. It was a Saturday ... there was just no one there,"" Warner recalled. ""We legitimately played on a football field, it was quite crazy because coming from Australia (it'd be like) playing on a rugby league field. ""Played with Timmy (Southee), (Trent) Boulty … it was great, I really enjoyed it."" Crowds this week will be bigger than the entire town of Oamaru, with Wellington Regional Stadium attracting its biggest cricket turnout since the 2015 ODI World Cup. That may be because New Zealand fans have been starved of matches against their arch-rivals. Next week, Australia will play their first Test series in the nation since 2016, while the one-day international team hasn't visited in seven years. Warner says future sides should honour the trans-Tasman rivalry by competing more often. ""Definitely Australia could come over here more,"" he said. ""New Zealand's come over to us probably six or seven times (since I was here last). ""The schedule has always been a hot topic but ... with our rivalry and being close neighbours, it just fits."" The Chappell-Hadlee Trophy was previously reserved for ODI cricket, but the governing bodies on either side of the Tasman Sea have agreed to put the trophy up for grabs in T20 series as well. When an ODI and T20 series is staged back-to-back, a points system will be implemented to determine the winners. Both families have applauded the shift, with Kiwi legend Sir Richard Hadlee calling it ""brilliant"". ""It's great that the trophy will have more visibility and profile,"" he said. Greg Chappell said ""having our family name on the Chappell-Hadlee is a great source of pride for Ian, Trevor and myself"". ""It will be particularly pleasing to see some young Australian players competing with their Kiwi counterparts for the trophy in years to come.""

ts23,"Gypsy O'Dea and her family's six-year ordeal began with a relatively minor insurance claim that turned into a litany of delays, miscommunication and questionable rectification works, causing catastrophic damage that exposed them to dangerous mould. ""For the first couple of years, we stayed in the house,"" Ms O'Dea told ABC News. ""Then we started to lose rooms to mould, with the two older kids sleeping in the playroom and the younger one in our room."" By December 2019, the walls were rotting, the carpet had mould underneath it and there was a bug infestation. The claim was with RACV insurance, which is sold through a subsidiary of IAG — the country's biggest general insurer. In late 2020, four years after Ms O'Dea's claim was lodged, a report prepared for the insurer found the home was not recommended for continued occupation due to the ""high level of airborne mould spores"". Instead of the family being informed of the risks and put in temporary accommodation, Ms O'Dea says they were told the house was safe, which was inaccurate. ""They told me it was safe and I had an asthmatic child,"" she said. They stayed in the house for another three months, unaware the house was unsafe and a danger to their health. The extended exposure to the mould-infested house left Ms O'Dea with a hypersensitive immune system, triggering anaphylactic reactions and hospital visits. When the insurer finally agreed to move them to temporary accommodation, the furniture and other home contents were moved to storage. Ms O'Dea said she told them repeatedly to make sure it was properly stored and treated to remove any airborne mould spores. ""We lost everything because of their storage failure,"" she said. When she put in a claim to get it replaced, she said RACV insurance told her she was underinsured. She said it was only when she threatened to make a negligence claim that it agreed to compensate her. ""I spent thousands of hours of my time emailing, phoning and trying to negotiate over six years,"" she said. After six years and two months, the house was finally repaired but the family decided to sell. ""We couldn't go back there,"" she said. In response to a series of questions, IAG said it was an ""error"" not to review the mould report when Ms O'Dea called in late 2020. ""The report should have been reviewed, communicated to Ms O'Dea and actioned by our property assessor and temporary accommodation arranged at that time,"" it said. It said the assessor was reprimanded, IAG apologised and it provided the family with temporary accommodation and paid some compensation to acknowledge the impact of the error. In response to the damage done to home contents, IAG said it required removalists and restorers to handle all belongings with care. ""Unfortunately, items were damaged during this process and regrettably, this included sentimental items,"" it said. In addition to the claim settlement for the water and mould-damaged contents, the insurer provided a further payment to cover the damage to items that was caused by removing and storing the contents. ""We know aspects of this claim did not meet our obligations under code 70 of the General Insurance Code of Practice and we logged the breach in relation to this matter,"" IAG said. General insurers are in the spotlight for many reasons, including premium hikes and affordability at a time when the country is facing a cost of living crisis. The sector is also being scrutinised by a parliamentary inquiry into its handling of the 2022 floods, chaired by Daniel Mulino, with more hearings this week before a report is released in September. A column I wrote last week about the inquiry resulted in a torrent of emails to my inbox outlining various dirty tricks employed by the sector to knock back all sorts of insurance claims. The message is clear: The industry's delaying and denying of claims and low-balling of cash settlement offers in the aftermath of the 2022 floods wasn't an isolated situation. The tactics are rife across the sector and policies. The systemic nature of the problem is reflected in the latest figures by the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA), which show general insurance attracted the second largest number of complaints, up 50 per cent to a record high of almost 28,000 on June 30, 2023. AFCA said 89 per cent of the complaints weren't linked to the floods. In addition, the General Insurance Code Governance Committee, the body that monitors and enforces insurers' compliance with the General Insurance Code of Practice, recorded an increase in breaches of the code, with 24 companies reporting 123 significant breaches in 2023, which impacted 4.6 million customers, up from 1.7 million in 2022. It said it reported 86 significant breaches to the corporate regulator, ASIC. It comes as ASIC confirms it has ""active investigations"" into insurance claims handling and dispute resolution. As premiums increase, profits rise and share prices rocket ahead, consumers are coming forward with harrowing stories of insurance companies delaying and denying claims that relate to fires, floods, travel insurance, mould, and questionable car insurance claim denials. On Friday two of the country's biggest insurers — IAG, whose brands include NRMA insurance, RACV insurance, CGU, Lumley and Swann, and QBE, a global player — reported significant increases in profit and strong premiums. IAG, which is trading at a four-year high on the share market, reported a 75 per cent increase in insurance profit for the December 30 half-yearly results to $614 million, with premiums rising. Global insurer QBE, which is trading at a 10-year high on the share market, almost doubled its insurance operating result for the year. Suncorp, whose brands include AAMI, GIO, Vero and Bingle, will report its financial earnings on February 26. Lawyer John Berrill, whose law firm specialises in insurance claims, told ABC News that delays in insurance claims and repairs had always been a problem but it was getting worse. ""What we are now seeing is rising numbers of complaints to the ombudsman, AFCA, which is buckling under the strain,"" he said. ""Complaint wait times are blowing out which reduces the pressure on insurers to resolve complaints before they get that far."" Mr Berrill said the delays in claims and complaints expose problems with the General Insurance Code of Practice and in particular the inadequacy of sanctions for breaches. ""The fact that insurers lined up to apologise for their conduct in the recent Parliamentary Committee hearing but then walked away without any consequences says it all,"" he said. Beefing up the insurance code to include compensation for code breaches on a case-by-case basis would be an important step to making insurers accountable for their claims handling and would drive badly needed improved behaviour. As the lawyer for Gypsy O'Dea and her family, Mr Berrill said the case highlighted the importance of accurate communication of the risk of mould. ""The consequences can be catastrophic to the property and the people living there,"" he said. In the case of 74-year-old Carol Jasen, who is on the aged pension, the battle began after her home was damaged in the September 2022 Melbourne earthquake. Ms Jasen lodged a claim but it was denied after the insurer appointed an engineer who claimed the damage was caused by a long-term deterioration of the property, which was excluded under the terms of the insurance policy. Confident the damage was caused by the earthquake, she then filed a complaint with the ombudsman, who accepted her evidence and stated the insurer was not entitled to the claim. ""The first copy of the scope of work didn't have [a] letterhead and they deleted purposely items,"" she said. Ms Jansen said she had paid insurance premiums for 50 years and hardly made a claim. ""They try to wear you down because they don't want to pay you out,"" she said. ""The entire industry needs to change."" The parliamentary inquiry is focusing on the floods but the issues are systemic. There has been a conga line of apologies from the CEOs of the country's biggest insurers. The inquiry's chair, Dr Mulino, told ABC News the sector had admitted in parliament that it needed to lift its game when it came to communication, case management and dispute resolution. ""The large number of claims arising from natural disasters is entirely foreseeable. While we don't know when or where a particular flood or other natural disaster will hit, we do know that natural disasters will increase in frequency and severity. The insurance industry needs to be prepared for this inevitability and strengthen its systems,"" he said. But as an industry insider, who requested anonymity, said: ""Their humiliating mea culpas at the parliamentary inquiry along with the manifest evidence of thousands of poorly treated claimants and complainants constitute multiple breaches of a range of legislative and regulatory instruments."" For customers like Gypsy O'Dea and Carol Jasen, it should be a clarion call for industry-wide reform and proper compensation. ""There's no accountability, there's no regulations to hold them to account,"" Ms O'Dea said. ""I'm speaking up because things need to change.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/general-insurers-use-dirty-tricks-to-knock-back-claims/103481382
ts24,"Around Australia, a growing number of motels are becoming custodians of vacant spaces. Restaurants once filled with guests are now being used as storage, conference rooms, or common areas with hidden industrial kitchens often sitting idle. Accommodation Australia CEO Michael Johnson says while some motels continue to operate restaurants and serve breakfast, the organisation has overwhelmingly seen a trend towards their closure for years. ""It's been on a steady decline for some years,"" he says. ""Certainly in the 60s and 70s when we built a lot of motels, it was the heyday. ""But we're not building motels anymore."" Mr Johnson says while motels still service a massive part of the accommodation market, particularly in regional towns, fewer motels are operating built-in restaurants. ""There are not too many motels now that are operating the restaurants or if they are they've cut back their operating hours substantially,"" he says. ""What we found today is a lot of motels would rather see you use external restaurants. And they'll just take room revenue as their bread and butter, because of the expense of running a restaurant. ""If you don't have a local market, your in-house market for a motel will not be enough to make it profitable.  ""It's also so difficult to get a good chef to come and live in a remote location, or regional locations where the motels are — so many of those restaurants are now meeting rooms."" According to Accommodation Australia, in 1985 there were about 2,700 motels in Australia but only about 2,400 now. This is evident in a photograph by Australian photographer Wolfgang Sievers, which depicts a full dining room in a Melbourne motel bustling with activity. ""It was the good old days where you checked into your motel, you had to make a booking for your dinner, and everyone in the motel pretty much dined in the restaurant because there was nothing else on offer, but now there are more offerings out there,"" he says. ""There was always that romance but then everyone works out that the accommodation is not that difficult to run, but geez the restaurant is difficult. ""Cost of food and beverages have gone up to the extent where you've got to be doing solid numbers to make a dollar. Otherwise, your rooms are making money and they're just subsidising your restaurant, which is losing money."" Mr Johnson says even without restaurants, a post-COVID boom in domestic travel has benefited motels Australia wide and he does not expect their presence on the market to go away any time soon. It's a familiar story to motel owner Sachin Gupta in Wodonga, Victoria, who says he was pleased to purchase a motel without a restaurant four years ago. ""Some of my friends have motels with restaurants as well, but normally they tell me it's not more profitable to run, and it adds a lot of stress as well,"" he says. ""There are lots of restaurants surrounding my motel, so I think the people have lots of options as well as uber eats and door dash. ""You spend lots of money to manage everything, but you can't really earn anything because unless you have a big motel with 50 or 60 rooms it's very hard to manage."" Geetu Nanda's family motel at Tawonga in Victoria's High Country is bucking this trend, offering something new. Ms Nanda and her and extended family took over the 40-year-old motel with panoramic mountain views six years ago, deciding to open the long-forgotten restaurant in a town with a population of only 568. ""This was a run-down business; they had not fully operated the restaurant for 20 years, but it's my passion,"" she says. ""We wanted to bring people back and open it again for the community. ""It was a big challenge for us, like how are we going to operate in a small town, how are locals going to react? We had a bit of fear."" Ms Nanda says the infrastructure of the former restaurant remained viable for its resurrection. ""The commercial kitchen was here, the cool room was here, so we thought let's give it a try,"" she says. ""There is nothing else here in Tawonga, and there are no taxi services to the nearest town. ""After we maintain the accommodation there's not much for us to do, so we feel like this is a good thing for us to keep ourselves busy."" Ms Nanda is one of a number of motel owners revitalising the old spaces and reaping the benefits.  She says the Tawonga community and visitors from nearby towns have responded well to the authentic Indian cuisine the restaurant is now offering. ""I think we made a small mistake when we started. We were only cooking Aussie pub food but one of our chefs said we should actually cook our own food, Indian food,"" Ms Nanda says. ""Now people love it, they love coming here, they love the environment. ""We may not always make a profit, but we're giving back to the community and that's what's most important.""

ts25,"In a system of caves on South Australia's Limestone Coast, researchers have uncovered new information about the coldest times in the continent's history.  A new study, published in Nature, from the University of Melbourne and the University of Adelaide used rock sediments from the Naracoorte Caves to give a snapshot of Australia's climate over 350,000 years.  Historically, the globe's climate has slowly fluctuated between cold glacial periods, or ice ages, and warmer interglacial periods, which the earth is in now.  In the Northern Hemisphere, these glacial periods were bitterly cold and brought very little rain, meaning humans and animals would hunker down to avoid the elements and to be close to reliable food sources.   In Australia though, the study found glacial periods were wetter than first thought, meaning the environment was more hospitable for people and animals.  Researchers studied the amount of rainwater found in mineral deposits such as stalagmites and stalactites in the Naracoorte Caves to understand the climate in which they were created.  Uranium dating allowed researchers to find how old the mineral deposits were, with the amount of rainwater inside giving an insight into how wet the climate was during formation.  Lead author Kale Sniderman said this meant flora and fauna were able to continue their spread around the continent during ice ages.   ""Researchers have tended to fit their findings into a framework of ecological refuges during what they think is a widespread, very inhospitable landscape,"" Dr Sniderman said. ""They say: 'This animal or plant needed moisture to survive, so how did it survive in an arid landscape? It must've survived in tiny little pockets, like deep valleys where moisture was retained.' ""But if that landscape wasn't really hostile, that inhospitability is a kind of misinterpretation."" The discovery has painted up to 350,000 years of Australian climate history in a new light.  Dr Sniderman said it would also change how climate experts looked at Australia's future, particularly in regards to climate change.  ""Within the full cycle of temperatures experienced in these regions over hundreds of thousands of years, the warmest times are relatively dry,"" he said.  ""In broad terms, this implies in the future as the world gets warmer because of human actions of putting extra carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, it's going to get drier still."" The Naracoorte Caves were formed over millions of years.  Made from the limestone that gives the Limestone Coast its name, the area was underwater about 200 million years ago, and once again about 20 million years ago.  That water carved out 26 caves, of which four are open for public tours. The rest are closed to allow researchers to work without disruption, or because they are too sensitive and should not be disturbed.  ""We have an embarrassment of riches in Australia as far as caves go and you can think about them as underground libraries of history,"" Adelaide University palaeontologist Liz Reed said.  ""Science is the language we use to read those libraries,"" Dr Reed said. The caves are also known for their significant deposits of animal fossils, including megafauna such as the short-nosed kangaroo and the marsupial lion.  Dr Reed said linking climate research with fossil studies would give a clear picture of life in the region thousands of years ago.  ""What we hope to do with our research is take our long-term climate records and then see what plants and animals were doing,"" she said.  ""That adds another layer because we're seeing responses from flora and fauna to the changes in the environment. ""That can help us understand, from a conservation point of view, where animals are going in the future.""  Manager of the Naracoorte Caves as well as the nearby Tantanoola Caves, Thomas Shortt said that the caves were an impressive natural formation.  ""Once you go into a lot of the research that's happened inside these caves you start to realise how exceptional these caves are,"" he said.  ""You see how valuable they are, not only for those aesthetic purposes, it looks really nice, but also from the fact we've been able to learn so much about Australia's natural history.  ""It's a real privilege to be able to work here and pass that knowledge on to the public.""  The caves are a UNESCO World Heritage site, alongside Stonehenge in the UK, the historic centre of Rome, and thousands of other globally significant places.  Mr Shortt said it was his team's job to teach everyone the importance of the area. ""It's not often you'd think of Naracoorte being in the same category as something like the Great Barrier Reef or many of those amazing buildings you might find through Europe,"" he said.  ""The caves here are up with those places."" ",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/australia-climate-history-study-naracoorte-caves-ice-ages/103455378
ts26,"From her home in Wagait Beach opposite Darwin Harbour, Yvonne Odegaard keeps her father's written account of the day hundreds of bombs fell on Darwin. “Suddenly there was a mournful drone, like a flock of bees,"" her father Leo Odegaard wrote.  ""We could not make out what it was. ""We all went outside and there were these silvery objects coming down, then suddenly there was one hell of a bang, one after the other."" In the early hours of February 19, 1942, hundreds of Imperial Japanese fighters led the first of two devastating attacks on Australian soil, killing more than 250 people in one day.  At the front of the Japanese Empire’s southward push during World War II, the Northern Territory capital and surrounding communities would suffer two more years of Imperial air-raids. Ms Odegaard said her father's only worry that morning was for the safety of his two young sisters. “Dad just grabbed the girls and ran down to old Dinah Beach, and they jumped into an old waterhole,"" the Larrakia woman said.  “They were just hugging each other, and dad could see the Japanese fighters in the plane shooting at them."" Mr Odegaard and his brother both later joined the army, having served in the Black Watch militia. But years later, in a cruel turn of events, Ms Odegaard said she and her sisters were forcibly removed from an army camp under the Aborigines Protection Act, which sanctioned the removal of First Nations children from their families.  Once reunited, Ms Odegaard said her father often told the story of the Bombing of Darwin and gifted her a full written account of that day. “The horror of that day in 1942 … it really impacted him,"" she said.  As the bombs fell in 1942, Richard ""Sandy"" Corr sought shelter beneath a cliff face, clutching a handful of undelivered telegrams. The 19-year-old postal clerk had fled the postmaster’s office with a colleague, and returned to find his workplace destroyed and 10 of his colleagues dead. Years later, as Mr Corr was dying from cancer, his son Patrick asked him to record key moments from his life in a single page document. “Three or four lines were dedicated to his time in Darwin, when he arrived [and] what he did while he was there,” Patrick Corr said. “It was only after he passed away, and my family and I had been to a couple of commemorations, starting with the 50th in 1992, that we started to talk to people he worked with, and found out things that happened."" Inspired by a fellow amateur historian, Mr Corr began researching the National Archives for any records relating to his father.  “I found this digitised visual file of what happened immediately after the bombing, and in it is a handwritten recount of my father being asked to explain his movements for six days after,"" he said. In response to the order, Mr Corr's father Sandy wrote: “I reported for duty at 9am 19th and was working in Private Box Room on telegraph returns at the time of the raid. I immediately rushed to the cliff in an endeavour to obtain some protection"". He explained that he had suffered injuries from the bombs exploding above, before helping to extract his dead and injured colleagues from the rubble and finding his workplace destroyed. “I considered this a splendid opportunity of getting out of town and trying to contact Adelaide and I did not think this was a time when I would have to await written authorities and instructions,” he wrote. Having discovered his father’s full account of the bombing, Mr Corr said he then knew why the details of that day were kept from him. “I understand now, why dad didn't tell much, because those are pretty traumatic things for a 19 year-old to experience,"" he said.  “I think if that happened to me, I wouldn't be telling my children that story."" Mr Corr and his family will attend the annual commemorations of the bombing of Darwin on Monday.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/nt-families-remember-bombing-of-darwin-on-82nd-anniversary/103480120
ts27,"When the trailer for This Is Me … Now dropped last month, collective confusion ensued, with headlines describing it as ""total chaos"" and asking, What in the hell is going on?. What: A genre-bending musical co-written, produced by and starring Jennifer Lopez. Starring: J.Lo, OFC. And a host of cameos including her hubby Ben Affleck, Kim Petras, Post Malone, Fat Joe, Trevor Noah, Sofia Vergara, Jane Fonda, Keke Palmer, Jenifer Lewis, Neil deGrasse Tyson (yes, the astrophysicist) and Indian spiritual figure Sadhguru. When: Streaming now on Amazon Prime. Likely to make you feel: Bamboozled. Was this Lopez's Everything Everywhere all at Once moment, but with singing, dancing and talk therapy instead of butt plug and bum bag martial arts fight scenes? Or was it, as Stop Everything! guest critic Maria Lewis suggests, ""J.Lo's Cats""? Well, I've watched This Is Me … Now, I've listened to Lopez during a press event for the film, and my answer is a very firm, ""yessss, maybe?"" to both. Billed as emanating ""from the dreams of Jennifer Lopez"", This Is Me … Now is Lopez's US$20 million ($31 million) self-funded feature companion to a new album, which shares the same name. Both were released last week. The title is a nod to This Is Me … Then, Lopez's 2002 album, released at the height of Bennifer 1.0, her first, failed relationship with now-fourth husband Ben Affleck. Co-written by Lopez, it reads as a genre-mashing steampunk musical x fragrance ad x rom-com dance movie x speculative psychodrama — and included the eyebrow-raising line: ""We think you might be a sex addict."" In the 90s, I watched Lopez on In Living Color, the Wayans brothers' hip-hop infused sketch comedy show. This was pre J.Lo, and she and her fellow fly girls — a multiracial crew of cute and mega-talented dancers — embodied everything I wanted to be but also found completely intimidating. Then came her breakout film role in Selena, and next minute she was acting opposite George Clooney in Steven Soderbergh's Out of Sight. After that, she was everywhere. Lest we forget — the early 2000s were peak J.Lo-saturation years. She starred in rom-coms like The Wedding Planner and Maid in Manhattan. On the music industry side, she became Jenny from the Block with the flawless skin and signature hoops. Her fashion choices gave us Juicy Couture tracksuit ubiquity and Google Images. Between marriages one and two, she dated Puff Daddy. And she made huge business moves — launching Glow, her first bestselling fragrance — setting a template for affordable branded fragrances that celebrities have followed ever since. What this means is that J.Lo has been marketed to me as a celebrity brand for roughly half my life. Even if I've never bought her fragrance or watched all her films, I can't insist, like Mariah Carey, that I don't know her. And that's why, 30 years into my parasocial relationship with J.Lo, I won't pretend I'm not invested in the wild swings of her love life. I won't deny knowing the names, in order, of her three ex-husbands. I've been stuffing my face with J.Lo relationship news for decades (and maybe you have too?). And that's also why, when Lopez and Affleck reformed as Bennifer 3.0 (Affleck's marriage to actor Jennifer Garner was Bennifer 2.0), and married in 2022, 18 years after breaking up, it felt like a prank and a grand reward: an unbelievable redemption arc! And I was there from the beginning! When, in the film, Lopez dance-montages her way through three failed marriages, while a cast of friends crack jokes about a cursed wedding bouquet, it's breathtaking. Where before we may have read the gossip posts and gasped, gawked or rolled our eyes from afar, in This Is Me … Now, Lopez lets us know that yes, she thought it was a lot, too. The punchline becomes the power move. ""There's not a project that I've ever been involved with, music or movies or anything, that I didn't put a bunch of my life into and a lot of my personal experience,"" Lopez said at a pre-release press event. ""I was at a point in my life where, as a person and as an artist, I could really look at all of the things that I was good at and the things that I felt and knew about myself, and put them all into this project in a way. ""So yes, there's parts of it that feel kind of very autobiographical, and then there's parts of it that are kind of meta."" While the result is baffling, I can't help but appreciate the reach and ambition of This Is Me … Now. Lopez is a woman in her 50s, dancing like someone less than half her age, singing, acting and processing her way through a musical feature about her often-mocked love life, that she co-wrote and self-financed. As far as choices go, this one is intriguingly crazy-brave and exposing. After the premiere of This Is Me … Now, it was announced that a documentary about the feature will be released on February 27, also on Prime Video. Humbly titled The Greatest Love Story Never Told, the documentary will tell the behind-the-scenes story of the making of This Is Me … Now. Has Lopez turned her addiction to love into an addiction to talking about love? There's a risk that all this multi-layered meta storytelling of this grand love story – me looking at J.Lo, looking at J.Lo, looking at J.Lo looking at her love — could cause a vortex that will shatter the space-time continuum, and my mind. But I won't rule out watching ""The Greatest Love Story Never Told."" If J.Lo wants to share, who am I to decline? This Is Me … Now is streaming on Prime Video.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/this-is-me-now-featuring-j-lo-review/103476176
ts28,"The movie/TV show dumping ground that is January is over, thank GOD, and the streamers are back to airing fresh content that's actually deserving of your precious time. Without further ado, here are our new-to-streaming in February recs. Do you feel like crying this week? Because this will happen if you decide to binge One Day. The David Nicholls book has again been given the drama treatment (yes, this is another in the string of Hollywood's never-ending list of remakes). But instead of being forced to process the whirlwind events of Dexter and Emma's decades-long love story in the form of a 108-minute movie like we did with the 2011 Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess version of this story, we have 14 glorious episodes to voraciously consume here. And that isn't the only reason Netflix's take feels different. Our story still starts in Edinburgh in 1988 on the night of Emma and Dexter's graduation, each episode finding them a year older on the same date as they ""grow and change, move together and apart, experience joy and heartbreak"" as best friends secretly longing for each other for the better part of 20 years. Dexter (Leo Woodall) is still the cheeky white posh boy who's grown bored of his rich friends and longs for the excitement a misfit like Emma offers. And Emma (Ambika Mod) is still the adorably awkward dreamer. She's also brown. Many of the people she surrounds herself with are of colour too. In an interview with the BBC, Mod said she thinks her casting ""opens up a whole other dimension to [Emma's character] and her identity"". ""I'm aware how significant it will be to a lot of people, especially young women of colour, young South Asian women in particular,"" added Mod, who is of Indian descent. And we have to agree. While we love Hathaway around here, Mod's lived experience as a person of colour who definitely did not grow up as part of the British upper class deeply lends itself to the ""rude, sarcastic and twitchy"" outsider Emma, who dreams of changing the world. As does the fact she also does stand-up comedy. And Mod's Leeds accent is flawless — unlike whatever Hathaway's attempt at the most basic of British accents was. Woodall's embodiment of Dex cements him as an up-and-coming leading man. You'll forget he ever lived rent free in your mind as the brash Essex uncle f****r Jack in The White Lotus. For fans of sad girl love stories, so: One Day (the movie), Me Before You, The Fault in Our Stars. The Mr and Mrs Smith you probably think of when you hear this show's title (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, no one's talking about the 1996 version of this story) are declared DOA in the opening scenes of this remake, when a look-alike spy couple are brutally killed by the new Jane and John Smith. It's clear what's being said here: Donald Glover (Community, Girls) and Maya Erskine (PEN15 — that's right, baby girl has RANGE) are the only relevant Smiths. As in the 1996 series (but unlike the 2005 movie), they aren't hiding their professions from each other. They're also not a real couple — the whole Mr and Mrs thing is a cover created by the mysterious spy organisation they just started working for. It's a beautifully awkward and titillating premise. There's little that Jane and John have in common beyond their occupation, desperation and love for Korean BBQ — making the slow-burn romance that is obviously to come all the more delicious. She's a messy and manipulative mixed Japanese/""Scottish — white?"" woman who mainlines coffee, is outspoken and brilliant, and just missed out on becoming a CIA operative because of her anti-social tendencies. He has only basic training after being dishonourably discharged from the military, is African American, fastidiously clean, does yoga in his spare time and loves a green tea. Glover, who is also a co-creator of the show, perfectly embodies Jane's quietly judgey ""husband"", oozing charisma. And it's hard to imagine Jane portrayed by anyone other than Erskine, whose signature awkward brand of humour cuts through the fast-paced spy action with the sort of ease and lack of cringe that probably keeps struggling Marvel writers up at night. She's so good we're not even sad that Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who was originally attached to the project as Glover's co-star, left due to creative differences. This, and the fact Prime somehow pulled a slew of stars including Alexander Skarsgård, Michaela Coel and Sarah Paulson to play supporting roles in the eight-episode series, makes Mr and Mrs Smith a must-watch. For fans of: Mr and Mrs Smith (the film), The Spy, The Little Drummer Girl. In The Know sees The Office (US) star Zach Woods return to his roots, giving us a new deliciously deplorable coworker to love to hate: Lauren Caspian, the middle-aged white man behind NPR's third most popular radio show, also called In The Know. Each episode of this stop-motion satire from Beavis and Butthead creator Mike Judge and Brandon Gardner follows the making of an episode of Lauren's show, in which the saddest, most deeply lonely man you've ever met asks celebrities questions he pretends have to do with them but are mostly about or for himself. Imagine a combination of The Office's Michael Scott (except he's determined to be the most progressive person alive), with Woods's Gabe Lewis, and you'll have a good idea of Lauren's character. He is scared of having penetrative sex with his girlfriend (also named Lauren) because he dithers doing so would be ""problematic"" somehow. He takes great delight in setting up ""racial roundtable discussions"" and describes himself as a sapiosexual who ""once got an erection from reading Plato's The Cave"". He has IBS (definitely not hot girl IBS). On those celebrities — they're real. ""Straight white woman"" AKA Cindy Crawford's daughter/model Kaia Gerber is Lauren's first interviewee, followed by Queer Eye's Jonathan Van Ness. But there's also Mike Tyson, Roxane Gay and Hugh Laurie. Lauren's questions run the gamut from: ""I'm trying to look younger. Do you eat breakfast?"", to ""Would you mind if I rant about the violence of the male gaze? Feel free to periodically chime in and say, 'Amen' or 'Go off queen'."" Lauren is a man who absolutely should have impostor syndrome but does not. His coworkers are equally awful/delightful. There's Chase, the white frat guy/intern; Carl, the office's single Black employee who is very tired of Lauren's bullshit; Fabian, the exhausting white queer; Sandy, the weird old white guy stuck in the past; and Barb, the straight, white middle-aged boss Lauren thinks of as a ""corporate fat cat"", despite the fact he earns twice as much as she does. The result of all this is the kind of rare, searing and original show that actually walks the line of culturally critiquing our current climate of political correctness with hilarious results. For fans of: The Office, Search Party, Arrested Development, Parks and Recreation. The synopsis for this show isn't all that alluring (sorry ABC iview): ""An ambitious Iraqi Australian family grapples with newfound power and privilege when their charismatic patriarch is elected Head Cleric of The Messenger mosque."" But House of Gods will consume you if you give it the chance. Some of the acting is admittedly lacking in plausibility, but it doesn't take long for things to start feeling more natural. And one faultlessly performed, disarming moment in the early minutes of this show will make finding out what happens next feel necessary. Antoinette Lattouf — yes, that Antoinette Lattouf — plays a minor role as a radio host interviewing the aforementioned charismatic patriarch Sheikh Mohammad (Kamel El Basha) on election night. A radio host who couldn't possibly ignore the photo of the young, unmarried woman kissing Sheikh Mohammad that just landed on her desk. Suddenly, Sheikh Mohammad's vision of turning The Messenger mosque into a place of inclusivity and unity is called into question as prominent members of his community flare up at the possibility his values may not align with theirs. And his entire family will pay the consequences. For fans of: Unorthodox, Messiah, The Twelve",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/one-day-mr-and-mrs-smith-remakes-what-to-watch-february/103470620
ts29,"When a commercial US spacecraft attempted to land on the Moon earlier this year, the Native American Navajo people weren't impressed. In fact, they were opposed to it altogether. This is because the Astrobotic Technology's Peregrine Mission 1 lunar lander was also carrying non-scientific payloads, which included 66 memorial capsules that contained human DNA and cremated remains. Payloads are items carried onboard a spacecraft which are predominantly used for scientific purposes to gather data from a mission.  But with more commercial operators taking to the sky, that's not always the case.  For example, with Peregrine, people who were willing to pay $US500 for a small canister could fill it with almost anything they liked, including ashes. However, the lunar lander failed to reach the Moon after a fuel leak, and it plunged back down to earth in a fiery ball. It wasn't the first time that NASA, which had five scientific payloads onboard the Peregrine, has been involved in upsetting the Navajo Nation, which considers the Moon sacred. While in this instance it was a commercial operator taking the ashes to the Moon, in 1999, the ashes of astrogeology founder Gene Shoemaker were sent there by NASA's Lunar Prospector space probe. At the time, the Navajo Nation lodged an objection against Shoemaker's ashes being taken to the Moon, yet nothing was done. Shoemaker's ashes are, to this day, still the only ones buried there. But as more commercial operators take up space exploration, do Indigenous people like the Navajo Nation or anyone else have legal grounds to object to items being sent to the Moon? Melissa de Zwart, who is a professor of Space Law at the University of Adelaide, says currently there are no legal grounds to prevent things like ashes being sent to the Moon. ""NASA agreed to undertake consultation if they did anything like that in the future,"" Professor de Zwart says of the 1999 incident. ""But of course, because this is not NASA, this is a private operator."" Chris Culbert, a NASA manager of Commercial Lunar Payload Services said as much in January. ""These are commercial missions. We don't have the framework for telling them what they can and can't fly,"" Mr Culbert said of Astrobotic Technology, which piloted Peregrine. ""The approval process doesn't run through NASA for commercial missions. I believe it runs through the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration], and if there are guidelines that the US government wants to apply, it would come through that process."" However, Professor de Zwart says that ""in using the space environment, it's important to take notice of people's connection to the sky"". ""We have similar objections being raised about … low-Earth orbit satellites that interfere with observation of the night sky that create different sorts of effects for astronomers,"" she explains. ""So our relationship to the Moon, to space and to the sky, as we see it, is increasingly being interfered with by these practices. And so there is a need for greater consultation about these things."" In the past, space laws have addressed issues surrounding contamination, debris and interfering with the detection of life, she says. ""It has not traditionally taken account of First Nations' and other people's relationship to that environment. So the whole issue of the environment of the Moon is something that … we need to do more work on,"" she says. And as space exploration becomes more privatised, issues like these will likely continue to arise. ""Without a doubt, we'll see a lot more commercial operators having all sorts of different payloads that are going to the Moon or potentially to other places,"" she says. Space is often described as the Wild West but that is simply not the case, Professor de Zwart says. ""There is a lot of space law. Fundamentally, we have international space law. The primary document of that is the Outer Space Treaty,"" she says. In Australia, we have domestic space law, which is encoded in the Space (Launches and Returns) Act.  So if an Australian commercial operator wanted to put a payload on an overseas launch, they would need a licence from the Australian Space Agency to do that. ""But where the complexity arises is, I suppose, just anticipating … where things might go wrong or be dangerous,"" she says. ""Up until now, licensing really has to do with things like national security, to make sure that there's no weapons of mass destruction on the payload and that the payload itself is kind of safe. So we haven't really had to worry about other things."" If deemed unsafe or not in the national interest, the Australian Space Agency could refuse a payload licence or launch permit, Professor de Zwart says. And if something dangerous or a contaminant was sent to the Moon, it would be an issue that would need to be dealt with by the country that launched it.  Professor de Zwart points to a case of potential contamination where an Israeli commercial operator caused an uproar after crash landing on the Moon in 2019.  There was a book onboard that had tardigrades (also known as water bears) enclosed in the binding, she explains. ""[That was to] see if these incredibly hardy creatures could survive on the surface of the Moon. And again, there was an outcry there saying, 'Well, that wasn't authorised, it wasn't licensed', and there was a lot of discussion about whether that was responsible or not to do that. ""So we've got people thinking a lot more laterally about what sort of things they might want to send to the Moon."" Another problem with sending humans into space is dealing with human debris. This is why Professor de Zwart wants more people thinking about environmental law regarding space exploration. She points to plans for people to return to the Moon as part of NASA's Artemis program. Australia is part of a multilateral arrangement that would see people living on the Moon and undertaking activities like extracting and using resources like water. There is a similar project led by China with Russia and a number of other states in the works. ""We know there's going to be a lot more people and robots present on the moon. So there's going to be a lot more things. And of course, we know that wherever humans go, we create junk. ""We need to start having these discussions now about what sort of environmental protection is relevant to the Moon."" There are already rovers, golf balls, bags of excrement, and astronauts' personal mementos left behind on the Moon. Sometimes people don't want to talk about going to the Moon because they think it's too difficult, she says. ""I think we have to move past that and go, OK, how are we going to do better environmentally when we go into space than we have done here on earth?"" ""What lessons can we take in terms of environmental sustainability and responsible behaviours … because we don't want it to be just another environment where we go up and make a mess of it.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/legal-ethics-of-sending-ashes-to-the-moon/103460322
ts30,"In 1937, one of the most popular names in American radio stood just 90 centimetres tall and was made of wood and plastic. Ventriloquist dummy Charlie McCarthy performed alongside Frank Sinatra, Groucho Marx, Liberace and the Muppets over a career spanning almost five decades. His ""sister"" Candice would become an award-winning actress who appeared in the sitcom Murphy Brown and movies including Miss Congeniality. Bringing Charlie to life was Edgar Bergen, a man described by puppetry organisation UNIMA as a performer who ""rose to national stature"" and left audiences ""spellbound"". On what would have been his 121st birthday, we take a look back at the — sometimes controversial — life of America's ""quintessential ventriloquist"". Born in Chicago to Swedish parents, Bergen was just 19 years old when he bought a ventriloquist dummy from a woodworking shop for $US35, according to UNIMA.  That would amount to about $US642 ($990) in today's money.  The puppet, whose ""immediate ancestor was a North Michigan pine tree"" quipped the New York Times, was made of wood and plastic, including human hair and glass eyes.  The hat was crafted from cardboard and fur. The shoes, leather.  Though Bergen started performing on the vaudeville circuit around the US, his act ultimately caught the attention of radio producers.  On May 9, 1937, Bergen's The Chase & Sanborn Hour — named for its coffee company sponsor — hit the airwaves and became a major success. ""A blockhead who wears three-and-a-half size hats and 2AAA shoes has built up a radio following of millions of Americans since last January,"" declared a New York Times article in November, 1937.  ""His name is a household word, his wisecracks are widely quoted by table wits and in current newspapers; his habits and manners are subjects for learned editorial comment.  ""Millions who wouldn't recognise a photo of ... Millikan, Einstein or Edison, know his picture at a glance.""   In December 1937, Baltimore's Evening Sun declared Bergen had gone from earning $270 a week to $14,000 a week in just 18 months.  Or, to put it in today's currency, the equivalent of about $US299,849 ($462,569) a week.  That following year Bergen was given an honorary Oscar award, made entirely of wood, for creating Charlie. Bergen's cast of characters widened over the years, including the hapless Mortimer Snerd and old woman Effie Klinker.  But it was Charlie who reigned supreme.  The popularity of Charlie — and his creator — did not make him immune to controversy and public outrage. Dubbed ""America's No. 1 Bad Boy"" in newspaper reports at the time, in late 1937 Charlie was on a collision course with movie star Mae West.  Charlie: ""Not so loud, Mae, not so loud! All my girlfriends are listening."" Mae: ""Oh, yeah! You're all wood and a yard long."" Charlie: ""Yeah."" Mae: ""You weren't so nervous and backward when you came up to see me at my apartment. In fact, you didn't need any encouragement to kiss me."" Charlie: ""Did I do that?"" Mae: ""Why, you certainly did. I got marks to prove it. An' splinters, too."" West, already in her 40s at the time, had her own reputation as a self-described ""twentieth century sex goddess"" by the time she appeared on The Chase & Sandborn Hour on December 12.  The 30-minute segment was not a success.  The scripts made several risqué references, including West referring to Charlie McCarthy as ""all wood and a yard long"".  Another segment depicted West and another actor as Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, cheering about ""forbidden fruits"".  According to historian John Dunning, the phone lines at NBC erupted with people calling to complain.  ""Within days, 1,000 letters had arrived, attacking the show's 'immoral', 'obscene', and 'filthy' parable,"" Mr Dunning wrote in On The Air in 1998.  ""Ministers railed. Chase and Sanborn customers threatened to boycott the product.  ""The Federal Communications Commission got involved. A transcription of the show was demanded and supplied. The FCC also demanded a a copy of the network's contract with the sponsor and the call letters of all stations that had carried the show.  ""The threat was implicit."" The reaction in newspapers at the time was no kinder.  ""Once again Mae West finds herself the storm centre of the amusement world,"" penned The New York Times a week later.  ""An editorial … described the broadcast as 'smutty suggestiveness and horrible blasphemy'. ""It has been hinted for months that the Legion of Decency was piqued by suggestiveness emanating increasingly from variously sponsored programs, but the Mae West 'incident' is the first to evoke public protest from the clergy.""  West would be banned from NBC Radio — the broadcaster claimed it was not the scripts, but her inflection which had made the jokes so suggestive.  Charlie remained on the air.  By the end of his career, Bergen had appeared in almost two dozen different movies and been given three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  Bergen's final film appearance was a guest role — alongside Charlie — in The Muppets Movie.  He had booked a two-week series of Las Vegas shows through to October 11, part of a ""Farewell to Show Business"" retirement set according to news reports announcing his death.  The show opened on September 27 at Caesar's Palace.  He passed away in his sleep on September 30, 1978.  As her father became a household name, his daughter Candice Bergen was a little girl growing up under ""the curse of having a wooden brother"", she would later tell Vanity Fair.  The actress — whose role in CBS sitcom Murphy Brown would later earn her five Emmy Awards and two Golden Globes — started her life in the public eye as ""Charlie's little sister"". ""My dad and I would spend Sunday mornings in the breakfast room. Me and my dad: It was our time together and usually it was just the two of us,"" Candice Bergen wrote in her 1985 autobiography, Knock Wood. ""And occasionally Charlie. ""Life was good … and there we were, in our secret Scandinavia, just like a perfect couple, you know, unless Charlie or someone was there. ""When Charlie was there, my dad would sit him on one knee and me on the other … and when he squeezed my neck, I'd move my mouth, and when he squeezed Charlie's neck, he'd move his. ""As Charlie and I yammered away at each other across my father, mouths flapping soundlessly, behind us, smiling politely, sat my dad, happily speaking for both of us."" The dummy ""dominated"" Ms Bergen's childhood, she would write in a later memoir. After his death, Ms Bergen and her mother sat together in the family living room and listened to a lawyer read the entertainer's will.  ""I ... bequeath to the Actors Fund of America the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars [sic] to be held as a separate fund, to be known forever as 'The Charlie McCarthy Fund',"" he wrote, according to Ms Bergen's 2015 book. The money, by Bergen's ""sincere wish"", was to be spent to fund ""charitable performances of ventriloquism at orphanages … and other such similar institutes for destitute and handicapped children"". The donation was vital to him because of its association with Charlie, ""who has been my constant companion and who has taken on the character of a real person and from whom I have never been separated even for a day."" For Candice, the message was clear. ""Charlie McCarthy was included in the will,"" she wrote. ""I was not. I'd chased my father's approval all my life and here was proof I'd never get it. ""Part of me thinks his withholding of money was his way of preparing me, giving me a sort of armour. ""But the rest of me is still baffled."" Edgar Bergen was buried with his parents in Inglewood Park Cemetery, California.  The original Charlie now resides in a covered case at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/edgar-bergen-charlie-mccarthy/103449262
ts31,"Learning to read is a fundamental part of every child's development – but Australian kids are increasingly struggling with it. A Grattan Institute report earlier this week found one-third of students are failing to learn to read proficiently due to persistence with an older, discredited way of teaching. The report urged schools to abandon the ""whole language"" method of teaching kids to read, in favour of the evidence-based ""structured literacy"". While there's no substitute for a qualified teacher, we've asked the experts for their best tips for parents who want to help teach their kids to read at home, using structured literacy. First up, it's worth pointing out structured literacy has at its core the idea that reading isn't easy and requires two to three years of explicit teaching in the classroom. So start by cutting yourself and your kids a bit of slack and recognise learning this foundational skill will take some time. Whole language, meanwhile, posits that reading is easy and natural, which evidence has increasingly shown is not the case, at least not for everyone. If your child really looks to be struggling, it's also worth exploring whether they have a learning difficulty. But don't rush into chasing a diagnosis right away, according to Professor Rauno Parrila, Director of the Australian Catholic University's Centre for the Advancement of Literacy. ""I would first figure out what is going on in the school – is it using explicit, systematic phonics [structured literacy] instruction?"" If so, and if other interventions haven't worked, that's when it might be time to look at getting a proper diagnosis, he said. Now we've sorted that, what are the core principles of structured literacy and how can you put them into action? Tess Marslen a senior policy analyst at the Australian Education Research Organisation said a good starting point is understanding the six big ideas behind the science of reading, which structured literacy is based on. The big six came out of a landmark international study that examined 10,000 pieces of research going back to 1966 to find the practices best supported by evidence. ""Parents play an important role in supporting their child's reading journey. The best way they can support it is to develop their understanding of the science of reading, collaborate with their child's school and work with the school to intervene early if the child is experiencing reading difficulties,"" Ms Marslen said. Let's break down the big six. This might sound like intimidating jargon, but don't worry – the concept is just that spoken words can be broken up into different sounds. ""Phonemic awareness is when we can identify and manipulate speech sounds. It might be like isolating the first or the last sound in the word. If I said the word 'blast', the child can understand the first part of the word is a 'b' sound and the last is a 't' sound,"" Ms Marslen said. You can then get more advanced and look at rhyming or alliteration. There's good science that children who grasp these concepts will be better spellers and readers. Experts say to start with the basics. ""You should teach your child, for example, to recognise the letters of their own name,"" Professor Parilla said. ""So you're helping them to attach the sounds to the letters. And that's the essential part of it."" This is another piece of education jargon and a word at the heart of the ""reading wars"". But don't worry, it's pretty simple too and builds on lesson one. Students will learn there are predictable patterns that will help them ""decode"" the words on the page. It often involves sounding out letters at the end of the word, such as ""aw"" in ""saw"". ""Phonics is understanding letter-sound relationships. So that's actually what happens when kids understand that a letter can be said in different ways. Frame has an 'f' sound but also cough has an 'f' sound but we write them differently. That's phonics,"" Ms Marslen said. Experts suggest this can be done in a way that's fun for your child either with magnetic letters on the fridge or silly rhymes. ""A very good language activity is to use rhyming books for example. So have fun with the language. You use different kinds of rhymes,"" Professor Parrila said. ""One of my children really loved the nonsense nursery rhymes books that didn't make any sense, but there was a good rhythm to the language and the other one didn't like them at all. He wanted everything to make sense."" Other games you can play with your child at home to reinforce the concepts include an ""alphabet scavenger hunt"" – where you identify all the letters in the alphabet in your child's favourite book. If they like a sandpit you could also try ""trace and say"" where they trace a letter in the sand and you say it. Another way to reinforce the lessons they get at school is to listen to your child read aloud and have them practice the sounds of words they're struggling with. Finally, a step without jargon! This is at it sounds – the ability to read accurately and quickly. Have your child practice reading aloud. The US National Reading Panel use this sentence as an example:  ""Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?"" Start with one word and go gradually from there. It'll likely sound awkward and stilted ie: But the idea is that with practice, your child will be able to read aloud ""effortlessly and with expression"".  This is an important skill because your child will be free to focus on the meaning of words rather than ""decoding"" them as above. It will take a significant amount of practice, but the reward is that it begins to unlock the true magic of reading. Woohoo! Another jargon-free concept. Vocabulary refers to the words we need to know to communicate effectively. Beginner readers must make sense of the words on the page by connecting them to their oral vocabulary. Studies have shown children exposed to a larger number of words at home will do better as they progress through school. A good way to do this is explaining the meaning of words when you're reading your child a story. It's best to focus on words your child doesn't already know the meaning of, such as ""remorse"". Words like ""mum"" and ""dad"" they will have in their oral vocabulary. ""So when you're reading books with your children, you can talk about the words in those books and then about the vocabulary. You can talk about the synonyms for those words. What other word could you also have used?"" Professor Parrila said. Are you still awake, class? We're close to the end. The idea here is simple – if students can read the words on the page but don't understand them, are they really reading? Probably not. When you're practising with your child you want to see that they recognise when they understand what they've read and when they don't. Create a space where your child can ask you what a particular sentence means. For example, ""I don't get what the author means when she said, 'arriving in Australia was a significant milestone in my grandma's life'."" Restate it in words they will understand, such as, ""she means that coming to Australia was a really big event in her mother's life"". As you progress through books it can be as simple as discussing the characters you've just read about. ""You can ask the child about the motives, 'why do you think she did that?' Things like that, so the children become conscious of the thinking processes that go into reading comprehension,"" Professor Parilla said. Ms Marslen said mastering the above five key points to reading, plus the final step, will produce confident readers. It may be the last step but it's another that can be started early. ""Oral language is understanding and using vocabulary to produce sentences. That develops in the early years, preschool and earlier. Children who are exposed to rich language early tend to do better,"" she said. It's a good idea to tell your child's school and teacher, so what you're doing at home complements what's happening in class. ""It's important to be on the ball early … following your child's reading progress,"" Professor Parrila said. It's also important they can put their new reading skills into practice outside of school and can see they're valuable in real-life situations, he said. ""Provide reading materials … and work with them in in writing cards and postcards to grandma, text messages, things like that."" If you'd like to learn more, a great place to go is the Australian Education Research Organisation. Did you know it's a government-funded independent research organisation with a brief to conduct research and share its findings to improve children's outcomes? You can find lots of resources there, including Tess Marslen's paper on the foundations of structured literacy Introduction to the science of reading.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/education-teaching-children-reading-learning-from-home/103470082
ts32,"It's finally here! Taylor Swift's much anticipated Eras tour arrived in Australia this week, and so, after months of waiting, young fans are frantically tying friendship bracelets together and brushing up on their fan chants. But take a closer look at those taking their (expensive) stadium seats in Melbourne and Sydney. There will be plenty of 40-, 50-, 60-somethings singing along too — and they aren't all there with their kids. While 45 per cent of Swift's US fans are millennials — like the 34-year-old herself — 21 per cent are Gen X and 25 per cent are Boomers, according to a 2023 survey. That means nearly half of her millions of fans are likely over 45. Middle-aged Swifties aren't shy about their adoration. In the US, Attorney-General Merrick Garland, 72, works Swift's song lyrics into conversations and legal arguments, and reportedly has almost all of her albums on display in his office. Oscar-winning actor Julia Roberts, 56, loves her so much that the first concert she took her kids to was Swift's 1989 tour in 2015. And recently the self-dubbed Silver Swifties were photographed shaking it off in their retirement homes. In Australia, AMP chief economist Shane Oliver, actor Toni Collette, former foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop and academic Larissa Behrendt have all declared themselves to be Swift fans. Even 60-year-old Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is reportedly angling for tickets to the upcoming shows. So what is it about Swift's lovelorn ballads, kitchen bops and revenge anthems, spread across 14 albums, that appeal so intensely to middle-aged people? Amy DeSalvo Umanoff, one of the almost 20,000 members of the GenX Swifties Facebook group, says her love of Swift's music comes down to the relatability of her lyrics. ""It's so easy to remember the feelings her lyrics conjure up,"" she says. ""It's easy to put yourself right back into her shoes. She writes for herself but also all of us, no matter your age or where you are in your own life."" Fellow member Courtney Thomas Joyce agrees. ""I feel like her lyrics are ageless and timeless. I can transport myself to that moment where I felt the same thing that she felt. She takes small moments and makes them normal, human, and helps us feel not so alone."" Writing universally relatable lyrics is something Swift has always been good at. In a 2008 New Yorker article entitled Prodigy, published when Swift was only 19 and just before her second album Fearless was released, music critic Sasha Frere-Jones compared her ""precocious wisdom"" to that of Prince, Elvis Costello and Hank Williams. ""You could also give a Swift composition like 'Our Song' to someone 20 years older and it could work just fine,"" he wrote. ""The concerns of kids aren't necessarily juvenile — just their reactions. Bridging this gap is the trick of pop music; when people sing 'Love Me Do' to themselves on their way to a date 10 years on the other side of their second divorce, it's a sign that a young songwriter has got to a universal truth. … People who aren't old enough to have lived the songs they've written nevertheless know how the song embodying that life should go."" The album that grabbed many middle-aged fans' attention was the melancholic Folklore, released in July 2020 when much of the world was in lockdown. That's when Australia Institute economist Greg Jericho, 52, got hooked. ""It hit me exactly where I needed to be,"" he says. He said prior to that album, he'd mistakenly believed everything Swift wrote was ""autobiographical and … always about her break-ups"". But Folklore ""wasn't that kind of an album"". Indeed, the critically acclaimed album, and its sister album Evermore, saw Swift explore a more indie sound, expand on the subjects of her lyrics and collaborate with alternative music stars like Bon Iver and The National. Academic Jennifer Beckett, one of the convenors of Melbourne's recent Swiftposium, describes Swift as a ""life writer"", comparing her to Dolly Parton, another country music star who became more mainstream and is adept at telling stories in song. ""Storytelling is the way that we understand the world. So [it's good] to have an artist like Taylor Swift, who's so good at storytelling, help fans to understand the world that they're in, and to make sense of the changes that they've gone through and how they've grown up or to re-understand something about themselves,"" Dr Beckett says. Swift's melodies themselves are sometimes reminiscent of an earlier time. ""She does have quite an 80s aesthetic in her work, even though it's got the pop aesthetic of now in her lyrics,"" says composer Caerwen Martin, pointing to songs like Wildest Dreams and Style from Swift's album 1989. Similarly, more mature fans appreciate her as an old-school singer-songwriter, Jericho says. ""I think actually playing music live, playing guitar, is something that older people like me …. can see something … that they saw in musicians that they'd liked growing up."" And for many, it's all about singing along to her catchy tunes. ""Her music is just so uplifting,"" says 50-something Leigh McCluskie. ""I'm a huge fan of dancing in the kitchen, I think that's what keeps you young, so I credit Taylor with keeping me young at the moment."" Much has been said about the sense of community that younger Swifties feel, but there's something in that for older fans too. ""What I think appeals to older women about Taylor, [about] being part of her fandom or saying you like Taylor Swift songs, is it comes with less judgement than it does with other younger demographics,"" McCluskie says. ""You're not looked down on, they don't go, 'You old woman, what are you doing?' ""It's a community and it doesn't seem to exclude people based on age, which I love. I do think that comes very much from the way Taylor conducts herself and through the messages in her music."" Canadian Carol Hansson, who runs that GenX Swifties Facebook group, agrees. ""[I enjoy] the fandom itself and how kind and generous and just funny everyone is,"" she says. Some of the GenX Swifties say they bond with their kids or even their grandkids via her music. For example, Kathey Reilly Hunt says she first learned about Swift from her young niece in 2006 and it grew from there. ""[Now] for my grandkids, I am the one leading the way. I love talking about the songs. Now we look forward to singing them together,"" she says. McCluskie agrees. She and her teenage daughter regularly dissect the intricacies of Swift's songs, and she can see how other mums use Swift's music to connect with their kids. ""If you can find common ground in that and it gives you a language to talk, or just have fun together … it's a bonus for a lot of women,"" she says. It's not just a maternal bond. Federal MP Andrew Wallace, 55, is such a big Swiftie, he petitioned her to make a stop in Queensland on the Eras tour — to no avail. He nominates All Too Well (yes, the 10-minute version) as his favourite song because he loves the music, the lyrics and the break-up tale behind the song. ""Just as the father of four daughters, it hit a chord with me. You know, just that really vulnerable age of young women."" He can see parallels between Swift and his daughters' lives, and the challenges they face. ""I respect her as someone who has grown through and lived through an eating disorder. My family has been through a similar situation,"" he says. For many middle-aged fans, watching Swift overcome challenges they've faced in their own lives is inspiring and heartening. More than one GenX Swifties describes her as a ""badass"" for the way she stands up for herself in a traditionally male-dominated music industry, whether that be counter-suing the DJ who groped her in 2016, taking back control of her work after her back catalogue was sold against her wishes, or pushing back against misogynistic criticism. ""She gives voice to GENERATIONS of women who are tired of 'that 1950's shit they want from us!'"" says Christina Cook [paraphrasing Swift's song Lavender Haze]. ""We've watched her handle herself with grace while being attacked for simply existing. She's also a strong advocate for disenfranchised communities."" Hansson agrees: ""She's doing it her way and she's not apologetic about it. And it's amazing, being able to see a strong woman persevere, and not take any flack for it."" Indeed, Swift's success is breathtaking. She's reportedly worth more than $US1billion thanks to income from her Eras tour, music and streaming deals. At the end of 2023, she was named Time's Person of the Year. And in February she made history at the Grammys as the first person to take home a fourth Album of the Year award, overtaking Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon and Frank Sinatra. As someone who knows how challenging the music industry can be, Caerwen Martin admires what Swift has accomplished. ""So many of us are cheering that she's managed to do so well as a businesswoman in the arts,"" she says. ""Her business acumen is astonishing. It really is something to step back and admire, because making money out of music is not as easy as people might say."" That she's retained control of her artistic vision is also impressive, Martin says, given a male producer often has so much sway in a recording session that female artists can walk out feeling as if the end result is no longer their work. ""I definitely cheered when I was hearing the stats about how much she'd made and how she'd done it and how she had released things. I'm just like, 'Oh, man, you've done it. You're very clever'."" Martin has another theory as to why Swift appeals, particularly to women over 45. She says for those who grew up in the 1980s, many of the musical icons of that time were highly sexualised. However Swift has what Martin describes as a ""very boundaried, almost anti-overtly sexual"" persona. ""When we were young … there was so much pressure towards the feminine sexuality overtness that perhaps we weren't really wanting.""  ""[Swift's] allowed to be herself without having to adhere to either a man or a male gaze and be professional and be successful. ""And she's allowed to have all of those things that we kind of dreamed of being and couldn't access, but can now … now we're older."" Finally those who are parents see Swift as a powerful role model for their children. ""[Swift] knows that when she stands up for herself that the message is going to her fans — because she's very fan-focused —  [is that] she wants them to emulate what she's doing, she wants them to know that it's OK to stand up for what's right. … It's a really positive thing for the next generation … it gives them power,"" McCluskie says. Martin agrees, remembering how pleased she was hearing her kids singing along to Swift's boppy LGBTQI+ rights anthem, You Need to Calm Down.  ""That point of view was so beautiful and gratifying as a mum to hear my kids so validated. So there's also that very, very strong appeal for women my age. ""Not everyone has children. But those of us who do really find it really gratifying, that there is an artist that our children can love that is safe.... [and who is] a strong advocate as well for things that we really care about.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/why-are-so-many-taylor-swift-fans-middle-aged/103457252
ts33,"When China opened its fifth research station in Antarctica this month, analysts sounded alarm bells about potential security threats on Australia's southern doorstep. Experts warned that China's expanding activity in Antarctica combined with Australia's inaction and lack of funding could lead to Beijing's increased strategic presence in the frozen continent. The new Qinling base could also improve China's surveillance capabilities and give it more control over transport routes to exploit resources, they say. However, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson insisted the new station would be used to ""provide a platform for joint scientific exploration and cooperation between China and other countries and help advance peace and sustainable development in the region"". Elizabeth Buchanan from the Australian National University’s National Security College said the Chinese government had a ""remarkable ability"" to plan for the long term. ""So, they may not be looking to utilise this research station for anything other than collaborative international research for the next 20 years,"" Dr Buchanan said. ""And then all of a sudden, it's a staging platform … to strike, to facilitate war if that day ever came."" The Qinling station, which will be staffed year-round, is located in the ice-free Ross Sea. ""Having the base ice-free means … personnel can travel [to the base] any time of year, so it is a very strategic positioning,"" Dr Buchanan said. ""China's positioning of Qinling is covering another part of the Antarctic quadrant of the landmass. ""Presence is power. Another location means better for launching satellites."" Dr Buchanan added that Australia should have been building its year-round airstrip there, pooling resources with India and other nations. Beijing's new Qinling base also fronts the Pacific arc, which has no choke points. Vessels travelling down the Panama and Suez Canal are facing challenges including falling water levels caused by drought exacerbated by climate change. This has forced the canals to lower the maximum depth limit on ships and has also led to a drop in marine traffic. The Drake Passage, a turbulent body of water that lies between South America and China's Great Wall station in Antarctica, may become a more popular alternative route. Dr Buchanan said China had spent the past 10 years building infrastructure in Chile and parts of Argentina, which had given it the ability to control the passage. ""They could cut off the Drake Passage in all sorts of ways,"" she said. “They [China] could make that passage difficult to pass and control shipping … or by having more boats to be able to monitor and block [the passage] with their own boats.” The former head of the Australian Antarctic Division, Tony Press, does not believe the new Qinling base will pose an increased surveillance risk because China already has surveillance operations in other parts of the world. He said China's construction of Qinling station met the fundamental obligations of the Antarctic Treaty for peaceful use and non-militarisation as per Australia's inspection of the station in 2020. Instead, Mr Press said what was ""alarming"" was Australia's underinvestment in Antarctica for science and logistics capabilities — particularly the lack of capacity to operate in all parts of Antarctica all year round. Official inspections of stations to monitor compliance can be conducted by any party of the Antarctic Treaty after a consultative meeting. ""I think the idea of building up Australia's capability to do more inspections could be utilised because they keep mutual assurance,"" Mr Press said. When asked about security concerns for Australia, a Department of Foreign spokesperson referred the ABC to the terms of the Antarctic Treaty, which prohibits the militarisation of Antarctica. The treaty was signed by 12 nations in 1959 during the Cold War and designated the continent as a ""natural reserve, devoted to peace and science"". Australia, being one of the original signatories of the treaty, has claimed 42 per cent of the continent as its sovereign territory — but that claim is only recognised by four other countries. Research by Anne-Marie Brady from the University of Canterbury uncovered several instances when China failed to declare its use of military personnel in Antarctica, including the use of a logistics expert from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to set up the BeiDou-2 global positioning system. Ms Brady said China's growing number of dual-use satellite receiving ground stations in Antarctica helped to improve the accuracy of China's BeiDou navigation system, which is China's equivalent of GPS. She said the stations and their territorial ambitions could help Beijing prepare for the ""interference of precision missile strikes and for targeting and communicating with various satellite systems"". Ms Brady added that China — along with Russia and the US — was honing its technology to generate high-frequency, electromagnetic pulses, which can be used to jam or even destroy enemy electronics. Beijing has previously accused Western media of ""hyping up"" China's activities in Antarctica. The ABC has approached the Chinese embassy in Canberra for comment. As competition for marine resources in the South China Sea intensifies, China could also capitalise on fishing in Antarctica, according to Daniel Bray, an expert in international relations from La Trobe University. ""It's relatively easier for China to come down to Antarctic waters, and fish in those areas, including for krill, which is a key food source for ecosystems and medicines,"" Mr Bray said. China has ramped up krill fishing in the rich maritime ecosystem of Antarctica, worrying conservationists and scientists who are calling for stricter controls. But countries are also finding it challenging to discuss the issues of monitoring and overfishing as they’re reluctant to ""piss China off too much"", Mr Bray said. ""[China's ability] in the Arctic and Antarctic, with its strategic reach and continuous shipbuilding program at home — pumping out locally built Antarctic icebreakers — offers the potential to lock out other countries if they wanted to,"" Dr Buchanan said. ""If you control the seas, you control the world, ripe for shaping international commerce,"" she added. Experts say China may also be setting itself up for a time when there is a scramble for minerals and resources, but also for sovereignty claims if the Antarctic Treaty falls over. Mr Bray points to fresh water as one of the overlooked resources in Antarctica, and the potential for future water wars. He said once the trust that was built into the treaty eroded, it could lead to competition to the south of Australia. ""The continent has got vast amounts of minerals, hydrocarbons, oil and gas, and you've got 70 per cent of the Earth's freshwater locked up in that continent, so China's positioning itself for the long game,"" Dr Buchanan said. Dr Buchanan said the Australian government was not taking China's new power status in Antarctica seriously enough. Australia is ""asleep at the wheel"", she said. Dr Buchanan said Canberra also did not have the ability to adequately monitor China and the activity between the Indian and Pacific oceans, which is a strategic arc for fishing. She called on the government to appoint a formal Antarctic ambassador, invest in more marine vessels, and build capacity in Hobart as a refuelling base that could resupply large icebreakers. The former Morrison government announced $804 million over 10 years to boost Australia’s strategic and scientific capabilities in Antarctica. But last year, Australia's Antarctic Division told staff it ""can't afford all current positions"" due to it needing to find $25 million in savings amid budget pressures. Dr Buchanan added that relying on one new ice breaker, RSV Nuyina, which primarily supports Australia's scientific research team in Antarctica, was not enough. Mr Bray said despite the investment, Australia still did not have the monitoring capabilities to keep across China's activities. ""China has made it very clear that it wants its fair share out of Antarctica,"" he said.

This ""miracle"" baby was a joy, but made her doubt years of medical advice and interventions — including 10 rounds of IVF — all based on a hormone test. The anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) test gives an indication of how many eggs a woman has left, but experts say it cannot measure fertility. Still, Mrs Loughnane's specialist told her it was a ""very clear guide"" to whether she could conceive when she came to him after a miscarriage in 2011. ""I remember very vividly sitting there with my husband next to me and the specialist saying, 'Your AMH is under five and this is quite dire. There's no way you'll be able to get pregnant naturally again,'"" she said. ""[He said], 'You should seriously consider IVF. I've prepared a booklet here for you, and we can do the first egg pick-up in a month's time.'"" Mrs Loughnane was 34 at the time. An analysis by Australian researchers, published in the British Medical Journal this week, has found feminist language is being co-opted by corporations to sell non-evidence-based health interventions like the AMH test. Tessa Copp, from the University of Sydney School of Public Health, said the ads promise female autonomy and empowerment.  But she said promoting non-evidence-based tests and treatments puts women at risk of being over-diagnosed and over-treated. ""The anti-Müllerian hormone test is currently being promoted to women in the general population, using sayings such as 'knowledge is power',"" Dr Copp said. ""They are claiming the tests can empower women to make informed decisions about their reproductive timeline, or give them knowledge about their fertility — to be proactive and take control."" This kind of language is being used more now tech companies have moved into online healthcare with direct-to-consumer products, the authors argue.  ""There's examples of some tech companies promoting diagnoses like PCOS (Polycystic ovary syndrome) and fertility clinics promoting egg freezing without providing adequate information about likely risks and outcomes,"" co-author and University of Sydney research fellow Brooke Nickel said. Dr Copp said women's health was under researched and underfunded, adding that ""in the absence of good clinical trial evidence and data there's been a commercial interest in STEM tech, because we have this huge need"".  Mrs Loughnane felt she was misled about her fertility by the AMH test.  After asking her GP whether to use contraception, she was told ""go and do another AMH test just in case"". ""I went back, he had a big laugh and said, 'Oh you absolutely don't have to worry about that, menopause is just around the corner.'"" Marissa Jacques got her AMH levels tested in 2019, at age 34. Based on her AMH, she was told she would fall pregnant easily and had ""plenty of time"" to conceive.  She said she was not told about the test's limitations.  ""My first specialist was like, 'You have plenty of time up until you're 40 at least and you'll have plenty of eggs,'"" the Gold Coast 38-year-old said.  ""I went about my life thinking I had plenty of time when in fact I did not."" After a second test in 2022, she was able to freeze 12 eggs, but believes she missed her chance ""to freeze a lot more"".  She was single but, like many women who freeze their eggs, she hoped to protect her fertility so she could have a baby in the future.  ""I felt quite misled and cheated in a way. I'm glad I did not leave it longer."" Dr Copp said the idea that knowing AMH levels helps women make informed reproductive decisions relies on the test's ability to indicate fertility — which it cannot do.  That could mean unnecessary, expensive treatments like egg freezing or IVF, or believing that because of a high result, you can delay pregnancy, she added. ""The evidence shows that it's not predictive of fertility, and so it really shouldn't be used outside of a fertility treatment setting."" Multiple studies have also found there is no link between AMH levels, Dr Copp said.  The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said AMH ""should not be considered a single marker for fertility"". The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said the test ""should not be ordered or used to counsel women about their reproductive status or future fertility,"" nor is it suitable as a predictor of menopause.  But healthy women who are yet to try for a baby are still doing the test, which can now be bought online, Dr Copp said.  ""There's a risk that women's empowerment and autonomy messaging is being used by commercial entities to market new technologies, tests and treatments that are not backed up by evidence,"" she said. ""And so this really risks harming women through inappropriate medicalisation, over-diagnosis and over-treatment."" Dr Nickel said women need health information that is balanced and easy to understand. ""We're not arguing women shouldn't be informed, we fully support women's autonomy in their health decisions,"" Dr Nickel said.  ""However, marketing and campaigning for interventions, and the provision of information without stating the limitation, really does more harm than good."" Mrs Loughnane's girls are now nine and her boy is seven. She doesn't believe she should have ever had an AMH test.  But the feeling is mixed. ""Looking back, how lucky am I that everybody said all that, because I wouldn't have this delicious seven-year-old boy — like, what a gift.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/egg-timer-test-amh-fertility-feminism-women-health/103457322
ts35,"""I don't know how to say this in a polite way, but Beff is evil,"" says German-American AI entrepreneur, Connor Leahy. The long-haired 28-year-old is talking both about and to his opponent in a YouTube debate, who goes by the pseudonym Beff Jezos, or just ""Beff"". He's the founder of a controversial movement known as ""e/acc"", short for ""effective accelerationism"". They're wrestling for control of the AI steering wheel, and their stated goal is to hit the gas as hard as possible. In fact, their motto is ""accelerate or die"". The e/acc movement is full of AI industry insiders — including top engineers, investors, and executives. They're waging a war against the AI safety movement, and anyone arguing to slow down — the ""doomers"" and ""decels"" (short for decelerationists). Beff's debate opponent Connor Leahy is just one of them. And while this conflict is largely unnoticed outside of Silicon Valley, its outcome could have consequences for billions of people, if AI is half as potent a technology as they believe it to be. If you ask e/acc, to slow down AI progress in the name of safety is to risk or even preclude the survival of the human species. If you ask the AI safety camp, we'll be lucky if the highly sophisticated AI they're trying to build doesn't destroy civilisation. Both sides boast some of the brightest computer scientists of our time, and a high degree of influence in Silicon Valley. So with all those hands on the wheel, who's driving the car? E/acc can be hard to pin down, but beneath the jargon, the factions and the memes, there's one conviction that unites them: when it comes to AI, faster is better. Beyond that, they tend to have an unshakeable faith in free markets, and somewhat counterintuitively, a deep distrust of big tech companies. Instead, they argue for decentralised control of important technology — especially AI. E/acc's biggest goal, like most of the tech industry in 2024, is Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI: AI that's smarter than humans across the board. Before 2030 is no longer considered a controversial prediction as to when it'll arrive. The most serious accusation levelled against e/acc is that they don't care if AI replaces the human species. Not all e/accs agree on this front — some think the more sophisticated AI of the future won't be willing or even able to harm us. Others think it might, but the reward is worth the risk. And a third camp sees AI as the next logical stage of evolution. They think humans have a responsibility, or maybe a cosmic destiny, to hold the door open for a higher intelligence, even if that means being replaced. A statement of e/acc's principles on its own website, states: ""If every species in our evolutionary tree was scared of evolutionary forks from itself, our higher form of intelligence and civilisation as we know it would never have emerged."" ""Stop fighting the thermodynamic will of the Universe."" E/acc sees itself as the antidote to an AI safety movement that's run amok. It believes a zealous but influential subset of ""safetyists"" has infiltrated AI boards and government advisory panels, effecting a paranoia and hesitancy about the very technology most likely to ensure humanity's survival. E/acc's full name — Effective Accelerationism — is itself a riff on one of the main subsets of AI safety, known as Effective Altruism, or EA, which promotes a far more cautious approach to AI. The most public moment so far in the war between AI safety and e/acc came late last year, during the board meltdown at OpenAI, best known as the maker of ChatGPT. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, was fired by the board over concerns he wasn't taking safety seriously enough. Within days, almost all of OpenAI's staff had threatened to walk out if the former CEO wasn't re-instated. After his return, the most safety-focussed board members, who'd led the push to fire Altman, were purged. They don't agree on much, but both sides of the war say that e/acc won that round. The victory at OpenAI, played out on a global stage, brought new energy to the e/acc cause. High profile figures in Silicon Valley started adding ""e/acc"" to their Twitter bios. Renowned Venture Capitalist Marc Andreesen wrote a ""techno-optimist manifesto"" and Garry Tan, the CEO of the influential startup accelerator, Y Combinator, gave rousing speeches at e/acc events. Grimes DJ-ed an e/acc party. There was merch. There was a flag bearing the libertarian symbol of the Gadsden snake. At the centre of it all was a man known only as Beff Jezos — one of e/acc's four founders. At the time, he was still anonymous, like most of the movement. Beff's avatar was a cartoon of an absurdly ripped Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, towering before an intergalactic backdrop. On X, formerly known as Twitter, Beff Jezos is an ostentatious meme-lord, issuing edicts about e/acc philosophy, fighting with ""doomers"", and worshipping the ""thermodynamic god"". The thermodynamic god is a kind of in-joke for e/acc; a reference to the laws of physics, and an embodiment of the transformational AI they want to see. He posts constantly about the urgent need for more powerful AI, along with wild statements such as ""I will die trying to make that happen"". As e/acc's profile grew, Beff Jezos seemed dangerous enough to Forbes magazine that in December 2023, one of its reporters did something drastic; citing the public interest, they doxxed him. That's when we met Guillaume Verdon. In the days after he was doxxed, Guillaume Verdon found himself sitting opposite US podcast host Lex Fridman, embarking on a marathon interview about his origins and beliefs. ""Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to figure out a theory of everything, to understand the universe."" It turned out the real Beff Jezos was a brilliant Quantum AI computing scientist. He's only in his early 30s, but he'd already held leadership roles at two cutting-edge companies owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet. Guillaume Verdon sounded nothing like his bombastic and polarising alter-ego Beff Jezos. When pressed by Fridman about e/acc's goals, beyond the obvious desire to accelerate technological progress, Verdon seemed to say that e/acc was about compromise. ""It's trying to find a middle ground between e/acc and … AI safety,"" he said. ""Having a movement that is opposite to … the mainstream narrative that was taking over Silicon Valley was important to shift the dynamic range of opinions. ""So it's kind of we're trying to bring balance to the force."" Verdon went on to imply that some of e/acc is using shock tactics for clicks. ""It's kind of a vector to spread the message. ""You get rewarded for polarisation … and so even though we started a movement that is literally trying to polarise the tech ecosystem, at the end of the day, it's so that we can have a conversation and find an optimum together."" If you take Guillaume Verdon at his word, e/acc's not even out to win the war, necessarily. He seems to be saying they just want a truce they can tolerate. For all the talk of moderation, Verdon is also a subscriber to arguably the darkest part of e/acc's vision — the part that sees humans as an opening act for a more sophisticated consciousness. ""I'm not trying to actually replace humans,"" he insists during the debate with Connor Leahy. But he doesn't sound all that committed to preventing that either. ""I think there's a lot of beauty in the universe … and it's a beautiful machine that has created us. ""Part of e/acc is to appreciate this principle in a way that's not just centred on humanity, but kind of broader. ""Because we cherish this beautiful state of matter we're in, we kind of feel a responsibility to scale it in order to preserve it, because the options are to grow or die."" Haodong Mo, a software engineer living near Gladstone in Central Queensland, is not that kind of e/acc. He's preoccupied with what he sees as AI's almost infinite potential to help humanity. ""You sort of get it into your head that, well, if there are these benefits, then we should pursue them,"" he says. ""If we play our cards right, maybe the future, even the near future, will be unimaginably good."" Delays to that future, for Haodong, constitute a special form of cruelty. ""Every single day, thousands of people around the world die of various reasons; preventable diseases, non-preventable diseases, war, conflict, much of it brought about by resource shortages. ""Every single day that you delay the creation of transformational artificial intelligence, which we believe will be able to solve all of these problems, you are allowing those people to die."" In many ways, he's a perfect fit for the movement. But despite sharing many e/acc values, he's not willing to call himself one. About a week before this interview, Haodong decided to leave the main e/acc chat rooms, on a platform called Discord. ""First things first. It's a cesspit,"" he says. ""They have a high tolerance towards, very, very far right people and trolls."" The final straw came, he says, when someone was advancing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that an evil Jewish cabal was trying to wipe out western civilisation. It's true that sexism, racism and general bigotry are regular features in the forum. ""I don't want to be associated with a lot of these guys. They're very extreme libertarian kooks."" Despite all the cultural problems and sometimes controversial beliefs about the role of AI, e/acc sees itself as optimistic. Perhaps the least threatening version of the e/acc worldview is captured in ""WAGMI"" — short for ""we're all going to make it"". To that, the doomers of the world most often reply: ""Sure, but what if you're wrong?"" Despite the apparent war, e/accs and doomers have a surprising amount in common. Both movements are full of people working in tech, who have always believed in it as a force for good. The question that separates the e/accs from the doomers is whether AI might be a special case — the first exception to the rule within our lifetimes. Self-professed doomer Matt Fallshaw sees other common ground too. ""There's a corner of e/acc … who really are imagining a future that's quite similar to the future that I'm imagining."" He's referring to the belief that a super-intelligent AI might lead to the demise of humanity. ""And I find it horrifying, and they're OK with it."" As the co-founder of a global accessories brand called Bellroy, Matt's a successful Australian entrepreneur. Behind the scenes, he's also been active for decades in AI safety circles. ""If we stay on the path that we are on now, I think we would have to be amazingly lucky not to create for ourselves, a future where literally, children don't get to grow up to be adults."" Matt is hopeful we've got a decade before reaching AGI, although he's mentally prepared for much less. ""My near-term horizon is I think we're going to wake up tomorrow [with it] but I'm not sure. ""We need to stop before a year. And that's really, really quite frightening."" Scanning recent e/acc posts on social media, there's a broad triumphalist streak — a clear sense that they're winning the war. Matt Fallshaw agrees e/acc is in front, and not by a little. ""E/acc doesn't have to do anything, they don't have to achieve a goal,"" he says. ""The default course is the thing that e/acc is arguing for; it is unrestrained progress to make more and more capable AIs. ""We are storming ahead at an alarming pace and I would love some more time.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/ai-insiders-eacc-movement-speeding-up-tech/103464258
ts36,"In 1974, two French doctors were called to the Iranian capital, Tehran. When the Shah of Iran was diagnosed with cancer, it led to a Shakespearean tragedy that has shaped the Middle East conflict we're seeing today. The doctors — specialists in blood diseases — had been asked to assess a government minister with cancer, but the appointment was odd. The minister didn't seem to want their professional advice, he just wanted to have a nice lunch with the doctors and a chat. But it was all a ruse. As the dinner was ending, they were taken into another room to see their real patient — the Shah, Iran's King of Kings. Iranian culture is extremely secretive about illness — even more so when it's the king who is sick. The Shah was in his 33rd year as his country's absolute monarch. In the eyes of the West, he was a benevolent dictator. He was in his 50s, handsome and fit, but told the doctors he'd felt a lump on his left side under his ribs. He wanted them to find out what it was, without leaving a paper trail. No X-rays, no scans, no charts, no notes. They did some tests, and diagnosed him with cancer — leukaemia. This cancer diagnosis led to a Shakespearean tragedy that not only brought about the end of the Iranian monarchy, but also directly led to the situation we are in today, where Iran has, for 45 years, been the arch-enemy of America. Since the Iran-backed group Hamas attacked Israel in October, both Israel and the United States have been striking other Iran-backed militant groups around the region, in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. Meanwhile those groups have been accused of attacking American military bases and navy ships. Open warfare between the US and Iran becomes more and more likely by the day, and it all began in the spleen of one man. Mohammad Reza and his twin sister were born in 1919 to a military officer with no connection to the royal family. His father was ambitious and violent — he liked to kick insubordinate subordinates in the testicles if they didn't follow his orders. When Mohammad was six, his father led a military coup against the sitting Shah, and seized the crown of Iran. The young crown prince had a difficult childhood. The new Shah thought that if fathers showed affection to their sons it could lead to homosexuality.  He didn't want this for his favourite son Mohammad, so he basically ignored him until he was a teenager. His twin sister became the more dominant of the two. Mohammad was reclusive, and many described him as ""sad"". During World War II, the British and Soviets invaded Iran and forced his father to abdicate. At the age of 22, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi became Shah of Iran. Mohammad Reza was very ambitious about what he could achieve as Shah. He saw himself as a man of the people, of sorts. He would drive around the streets of Tehran in one of his many sports cars and chat with average Iranians. He vowed not to be crowned until his people were educated, well-fed and lived lives equivalent to Europeans. Thankfully, the enormous oil reserves found under the Iranian desert made that a real possibility. The Shah intensified the modernisation program started by his father. Supported by the British and American connections he'd made during the war, he spent big on road, rail, health, education and defence projects. But his reputation as a man of the people didn't last. In 1948 while out in public, he was shot, and he withdrew from contact with the public. And after a coup in 1953, the Shah decided he couldn't trust a government to deliver his modernisation plans, so he dispensed with democracy altogether. The Shah decided he would modernise the country through sheer force of will. The feudal system was abolished and gradually, the big estates of wealthy landowners were shared among their former serfs. He believed that once the country was industrialised, it would be ready for democracy. By the mid-70s, Iran established itself as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Women were able to work and vote, and many young people wore 70s European fashion. His regime was celebrated by western leaders, but it was far from perfect. The Shah surrounded himself with 'yes' men, and led a regime many would later describe as ""remarkably repressive"". His position was protected by the fast-growing military and agents of the SAVAK secret police, who kidnapped and tortured political opponents. After his cancer diagnosis at the age of 54, the Shah feared his teenage heir would be unable to complete his modernisation efforts. The plan would have to be accelerated. Government spending increased. He started lending huge amounts of money to neighbouring countries, hoping to increase the general stability of the Middle East by making everyone richer. With American help, he set up a nuclear energy program, hoping to fast-track his country into superpower status with nuclear power and possibly nuclear weapons. To secure his family's position, he entered into a number of spectacular arms deals with Western countries. But many Iranians were upset by his leadership. Persian culture had a 2,500 year old history, and the Shah was trying to replace that in the few years he had left. His reforms were also undermined by corruption and the secret police became more brutal. Months of violent riots and protests followed. In February 1979, 45 years ago this week, the revolution was complete. The monarchy collapsed, the Shah fled the country, and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, an Islamic religious leader, took control. The Shah was in a predicament. Other countries were building relationships with Iran's new rulers, and didn't want to anger them by giving the Shah refuge. He was forced to bounce from country to country, all the while becoming more and more unwell. Years of trying to keep his condition a secret had led him to get worse medical care than even a middle class Iranian would have been able to get. He wound up in Mexico, where the doctors thought he had malaria, and suggested he be transferred to New York for specialist treatment. And despite the risk that this would seriously irritate the Ayatollahs, president Jimmy Carter agreed. As expected, it did irritate the Ayatollahs. The chief justice of Iran's new Revolutionary Court put a bounty on the Shah's head and issued this statement: ""I have asked all Muslims and Iranian students in the United States to wait outside the hospital, and then go inside and take him away. ""I don't know if the Shah has cancer or not, but in any case, he must die."" Nobody killed the Shah in New York, but in Tehran, a large group of Iranian students decided to take vengeance on the Americans, through their embassy. Armed students took over the US Embassy, and held 52 diplomats hostage. They demanded Washington send the Shah back from America, but the United States refused. The US piled crushing sanctions onto the Iranian economy to try and force the government to send the hostages back. The hostages were released the hour after president Carter left office — a deliberate punishment against him. By then, the Shah was dead, and the damage was done. The hostage crisis led to sanctions, and the sanctions were never lifted. The US and Iran have been enemies ever since. This is the lasting legacy of the Shah. He's a man who instituted sweeping reforms, many of which — the giant military, the nuclear program, the secret police — are now keeping the Ayatollahs in power. He is also a man who was supported, then harboured by America, leading to a retaliation. And a lasting atmosphere of hostility between the US and Iran. So far, the tension has not exploded into open warfare. Hopefully it stays that way.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/how-iran-became-americas-enemy/103461790
ts37,"When Thomas Gerstner arrived in the lobby of a Munich hotel in 2016, the German football coach had a feeling that his life was about to take a bizarre turn. As he sat in a low armchair, nervously inspecting the faces and outfits of every stranger who walked through the revolving door, he thought about the WhatsApp message he'd received a few weeks earlier. Jørn Andersen, a friend and colleague, had reached out to Gerstner with a peculiar question. Could he ever imagine coaching the North Korean women's national team? Gerstner was stunned. He didn't know very much about North Korea, but what he did know concerned him. It was one of the most secluded and secretive countries on earth, led by an infamous dictator who regularly tested missiles, held enormous public military parades, shut down all forms of dissent and opposition, and ruled his people with an iron fist. And his friend wanted to invite him behind the curtain. Gerstner hadn't coached at a high level for a number of years, and never outside of Europe. But he was always interested in experiences that would challenge and change him, both as a coach and as a person. So after mulling it over for a few weeks, he agreed to meet with representatives from North Korea's Sports Ministry to discuss the role. That's how he ended up sitting in the lobby of this Munich hotel in September, waiting for whatever future was about to open up ahead of him. ""It was a very good conversation,"" Gerstner tells ABC Sport. ""And after about two and a half hours, I received an offer and time to think about it. ""I felt good: the way you feel with a pleasant conversation partner, and an offer that was hard to refuse."" For a football coach who hadn't had a major gig in five years, the offer certainly was difficult to ignore: a highly-paid national team position, the ability to choose his staff, a large hotel room entirely paid for. He was even promised his own guide and a private driver. Gerstner, throwing caution to the wind, said yes. He was given six months to prepare to leave his home in Germany for what he described in a Swedish newspaper as ""the greatest adventure of my life"". ""At first, everything seemed surreal,"" he says. ""I got an interpreter, a chauffeur, a large suite with a study, was accommodated in a hotel with five restaurants and a wellness area. ""The style of my suite was very old-fashioned and took some getting used to, but I quickly got used to the new surroundings and conditions. ""At the beginning, I had countless conversations with possible assistant trainers, analysts, physiotherapists and doctors. ""All the people in my work environment were very friendly, nice and accommodating. Everyone always tried to fulfil my demands and wishes. There were no private contacts, and people there were forbidden to make friends with foreigners. ""Maintaining contact with people from the DPRK is impossible anyway because they have no access to the internet and cannot communicate outside. Their cell-phones only have intranet SIM cards; they can communicate with each other, but not with foreigners at home or abroad."" Gerstner arrived in May 2017, and was tasked with coaching the North Korean under-20s women's national team. He joined at a crucial time: North Korea had just won the U17 and U20 FIFA Women's World Cups the previous year, and that new generation of players was now preparing to step up into the senior side. He was brought in to help them on their way. But first, he was tasked with trying to win the U-20 Women's Asian Cup, which would allow them to defend their World Cup title in France the following year. And he had just five months to prepare. Five months to learn all he could about how North Korean women footballers were developed. He'd seen their records at international level — the incredible success of their youth teams, juxtaposed with the slow slide of the senior team over the past decade — but had little idea of how the women's game actually worked behind the curtain of the country. How do they identify players? Where do they train? Are there domestic competitions? What is the support like for players on and off the field? And who makes all the decisions anyway? Football in North Korea is not how it looks in the rest of the world. There are two separate streams for players in the country: the domestic leagues and the national teams. Domestically, club football is run by the DPRK Football Association, with the highest division consisting of around 13 teams who play against each other in condensed, round-robin style tournaments held every two months across the year. All clubs in the DPRK represent different state enterprises or organisations, such as tram factories or government departments or the military, which have both men's and women's teams. The most popular and successful club is 4.25 Soccer Club: a reference to April 25th, the day that North Korea's army was founded in 1978. The oldest club in the country is Amrokkang Sports Club, the international security team that was founded in 1947, making it older than North Korea itself. But information about these domestic leagues and who plays in them is scarce. Results are not published, there are no advertisements for their games (there are no advertisements for anything in North Korea), matches are not televised, and there are no public records of team lists or officials or crowd numbers. It's unknown whether players are full-time athletes, or if football is simply an activity they participate in on the side of their other work. Some of the clubs' best players are supposedly given special treatment, such as nicer apartments and extra food rations, but what their everyday lives are like remains a mystery. According to Gerstner, the national teams operate differently. ""All players from the various national teams are in the National Training Centre (NTC) 24/7 and do not play for clubs after they've been selected,"" Gerstner says. ""They are trained six days a week in the NTC. There's no payment for this; there is no payment as far as we know it for anyone in the country. ""They're accommodated in the NTC, receive full meals, and are simply proud to represent their country. They are taught there every day and enjoy being privileged. ""There is no community support for football. During international matches, people from the military and universities are ordered to go to their national team's games. ""This means that one of the largest stadiums in the world [the May Day Stadium, with a capacity of 150,000 people] is filled with around 50% uniformed soldiers and 50% students. ""In the DPRK, no one decides whether he or she will play football; that is decided elsewhere. Every person who has a special talent for something receives maximum support in this area, whether it's piano lessons or horse riding or soccer training."" Decided by whom? Gerstner doesn't say. But his comment points to the more shadowy aspects of North Korean football, which is where much of the external intrigue lies. By almost any metric, the DPRK is viewed as one of the most oppressive political regimes in the world. It regularly ranks at the bottom of lists regarding press freedom, while individual liberties are heavily restricted. Public opposition to the regime can lead to punishments such as torture, forced labour, and imprisonment. Allegiance to the one-party leadership is paramount. According to the United Nations, North Korea is a state ""that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world"". As such, very few foreigners have been granted access inside the DPRK to observe the way football operates domestically. And even when they have, their experiences have been completely controlled by what the state wants them to see. In 2008, Austrian film-maker Brigitte Weich was allowed into the country to produce a documentary called ""Hana, Dul, Sed"": a film that followed four women's national team players through their football careers and into what was implied as forced retirement after they failed to qualify for the 2004 Olympics. ""I'd never seen anything like Pyongyang before,"" Weich wrote on the film's website. ""It is impossible to move about freely in the city: the moment you arrive at the airport, you are met by a guide who, except when you are at your hotel, never leaves your side until you are back on the plane heading home. ""Like every North Korean, your guide wears a lapel badge bearing the image of either Kim Il Sung or Kim Jong Il, and every second sentence she or he utters is in praise of the 'Great Leader,' who is responsible for all the wonderful things you are being shown during your visit. ""This experience came as a complete shock and made me wonder how things had come to be the way they were there, and alternately how they had ended up the way they were 'back home.' ""I am often asked whether it wasn't terribly restrictive to shoot a film in a totalitarian Big Brother regime. ""But to me, the restrictions were already part of the story: we didn't want to show how we saw North Korea, we wanted to see what these women would show us."" Since the country's founding in 1948, the DPRK has gone to extreme lengths to control its projected image to the rest of the world. Anecdotes from foreign tourists, athletes, and journalists recount how micro-managed their experiences are, with their entire trip feeling like a stage-play, like something not quite real. In Pyongyang, the capital, the streets and buildings and parks are impossibly clean. Enormous posters depicting the Kim family are hung from bridges and lamp-posts, traffic is quiet and sparse, and public crowds are minimal. The dirt and scars of a lived-in country are swept beneath the facade of this impeccable place, with poor and rural populations kept out of sight. Contact between the inside and the outside world is heavily controlled. Jerome Champagne, a former FIFA official, recalled that there was just one way to communicate with the entire DPRK association during his time with the governing body. ""There was one fax number,"" he says in an interview. ""You sent a fax. Sometimes you got a reply."" These days, there is supposedly a single email address. You're never guaranteed a response. North Korea shows you only what it wants you to see. Football has been one of North Korea's most visible — and most vulnerable — doorways to the outside world. The country's founding leader, Kim Il Sung, regularly emphasised the importance of sport and physical fitness as a projection of the nation's self-image on the global stage. ""We should popularise physical culture and sport, make them part of our everyday life, and thus improve the physical fitness of the entire nation,"" he once told the Sixth Congress of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea in 1980. ""We should also rapidly develop our sporting science and skill."" Football's role as a pillar of North Korean strength and character was captured in an internally-produced 1978 film titled ""Centre Forward,"" which tells the story of a young male footballer who embarks on a Rocky-esque journey to work hard and improve his fitness and skill in order to represent the senior team. ""Communist countries want to gain a high level of appreciation outside of their countries through sport, and especially football,"" Gerstner says. This love of the game appears to run in the family, with the country's current leader, Kim Jong Un, regularly attending football matches at home. He is supposedly a big Manchester United fan, and has in the past ordered the state broadcaster to show the club's matches on public television: a rarity in the tightly-controlled media landscape of North Korea. The first serious glimpse that the world got of North Korean football was back in 1966, when the men's national team — nicknamed ""Cheollima"", the name of a mythical horse that can cover 400km in a single day and cannot be mounted by a mortal human — qualified for the FIFA World Cup finals in England. Their remarkable run, which was later documented in a film titled ""The Game of Their Lives,"" included a famous 1-0 win over Italy in one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history. That win, which followed a draw against Chile, saw them become the first Asian team to reach the quarter-finals of the tournament. They lost the next game to Portugal 5-3, but the few surviving players from that side have been hailed as heroes in North Korea (and, oddly enough, in Middlesbrough, where they were based during the World Cup) ever since. As part of this bigger vision of using sport as a geopolitical tool, and keeping with Kim Il Sung's plan to rapidly improve their sporting prospects, North Korea has heavily invested in facilities and infrastructure to give its athletes the best possible chance to dominate on the world stage. This investment has been particularly effective in the women's game, with North Korean teams dominating the youth levels and Asian competitions over the past two decades. The Taesong District Juvenile Sports School in the capital Pyongyang is one of the most famous training bases. It has had its own women's football program since 1999, working closely with the Academy of Sports Science to monitor players over multiple age groups and design training programs to maximise their physical abilities. The school holds 'exams' of a sort, testing thousands of fledgling footballers to assess their suitability for international competition. Football is part of the curriculum, with theory and physical training built into a child's everyday study. Schools regularly compete against each other in tournaments across the provinces. Some of the players who won the DPRK's first ever World Cup — the U-20 Women's World Cup in 2006 — were apparently developed at the Taesong training base, and were awarded the titles of ""Labour Hero"" and ""Peoples' Sportsperson"" upon their return. Indeed, North Korea appears to have been ahead of the curve in building gender equality into its football development structures.  In a 2019 visit to the DPRK, journalist James Montague observed that female players were given the same facilities, opportunities, coaching, and equipment as male players, and were already far more advanced at junior level. Since 2012, the genders have supposedly been mixed together ""to help the boys improve"", according to one of the interviewed coaches. So popular is women's football in North Korea that KCT even once developed its own mini-series in 2011 titled ""Our Women's Soccer Team"", which showed a fictionalised group of national team players navigating modern-day North Korea and inspiring young people with their football skills. As a result, North Korea has been a surprising force on the continental stage since the 1990s. They broke China's stranglehold on the Women's Asian Cup when they won their first title in 2001, and then won it twice more in 2003 and 2008. They've won the Asian Games three times, too, as well as finishing runners-up three times more, including in the most recent edition last year. On the global stage, they've participated in the Women's World Cup four times — twice as many as their men's team — including progressing to the knock-outs back in 2007. They've also been to two Olympic Games, in 2008 and 2012, but have failed to make it past the group stage. Despite that, North Korea has been a mainstay in the FIFA top ten rankings for over a decade. They were only de-listed last year after a long period of inactivity brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. They returned to the rankings in late 2023 and currently sit ninth, three places above the Matildas. It's a curious ranking given North Korea has not participated in a major international tournament since their last Olympics in 2012. When contacted for comment, FIFA said the 'inactivity' period had been extended from 18 to 48 months during the pandemic, in line with the men's side. But they did not elaborate on why the DPRK had maintained its top 10 ranking despite no major competitions in the past ten years. Ranking mysteries aside, rumours have been swirling for decades that North Korean players are provided with more than just coaching, nutrition, facilities and equipment that have made them so competitive. During the 2011 Women's World Cup in Germany, five senior North Korean players failed doping tests. The federation was fined $400,000 and banned from qualifying for the 2015 World Cup in Canada. The official explanation given by the DPRK was that their players had been struck by lightning and treated with a traditional medicine made from deer musk glands, which contributed to false-positive drug test results. In fact, so unusual was this substance that it had never before been detected by anti-doping technology anywhere in world sport, so it was not part of any regulations. FIFA banned the country anyway, but the International Olympic Committee did not, allowing the DPRK to participate in the 2012 London Olympics. And the team who missed out on qualifying for the Games that year due to North Korea's involvement? Australia. Indeed, the Matildas have a long, tense history against the DPRK. They've met several times in international competition, most notably in the final of the 2010 Women's Asian Cup, where Australia won on penalties. On the rare occasions that North Korea have travelled to Australia to play, controversy has followed. In 2006, at the Women's Asian Cup hosted in Adelaide, DPRK officials requested that their page in the tournament's official guide be ripped out of every single copy and destroyed. A week later, in the final minutes of a semi-final between North Korea and China, an equalising goal for the DPRK was called offside by the referee. When the full-time whistle signalled a 1-0 win to China, the furious North Korean goalkeeper shoved the referee and earned a straight red card. Her team-mates then chased the referee and her assistants, throwing bottles of water at them as they ran, before police had to intervene and escort the officials off the field for their own safety. It's not known what happened to those players, nor the ones who were found to have doped at the 2011 World Cup once they returned to the DPRK, but it is widely believed that punishment for athletes who fail or embarrass the state on the global stage can be severe. For example, after the men's national team were bundled out of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa — losing 7-0 to Portugal in a rare live sports broadcast that was shown across the country — North Korean leaders reportedly carried out six hours of public humiliations of the players in front of over 400 government officials, while their head coach was banished to a building site. An investigation by FIFA cleared DPRK of the allegations later that year. But the shadow of the curtain still lingers. This was the strange, secretive world that Gerstner became familiar with during his time with the U20 women's national team as they prepared for the 2017 Asian Cup in China. Just as football gives the world a glimpse inside North Korea, the game also gives North Koreans a glimpse of the world. But such glimpses can be risky, and the country's leaders put as many protocols in place as they can to ensure that a glimpse doesn't turn into something more. ""The players were very shy at first,"" he says. ""And they had been approved by the association, so they knew exactly how they had to behave towards me according to the instructions. ""Day by day, they became looser and funnier, whispered and laughed and visibly blossomed. ""However, direct communication was never possible because everything went through Mrs Hwang, my interpreter. ""After about three months, I invited the whole team to dinner at my hotel, in the revolving restaurant high above the city. They saw Pyongyang from above for the first time; I will never forget those surprised but happy faces. ""The players on my team were happier than many young people in Western countries are. They don't miss anything, and are grateful for everything and have great respect."" North Korean national teams hardly ever travel beyond their borders, so when they do, there are strict rules in place. Coaches and players are rarely, if ever, interviewed by foreign media, and don't appear in public media conferences unless required to by competition organisers. In shared hotels, North Korean players and staff stick together, ignoring those from other countries, knowing that they're likely being monitored by their own government's officials at all times. They sometimes reserve entire floors or wings for themselves to ensure they don't interact with anyone else. Gerstner was informed of all these rules before he set off with his team to China in October of 2017. ""Of course, I was concerned that one or more of the players might disappear during our trip and not return to DPRK,"" he says. ""But I was reassured that this would not happen and that I was not responsible for it. ""We travelled to Nanjing with almost 30 players and as many staff members and officials to play in the Asian Cup and qualify for the 2018 U20 World Cup in France. To do this, we had to finish at least third. ""The players were very excited, but also proud that they would experience something that only a few people in DPRK get to experience. ""I suggested visiting a Chinese market on a non-game day. At first, those responsible were surprised, but with the argument of variety and reward, we actually all went to the Chinese market. ""The players each received $10 and were allowed to buy something to remember [the trip] by, and of course everyone knew that this was my idea. ""Everyone performed really well. Unfortunately, we lost the final to Japan 0-1, but we qualified for the World Cup by reaching the final. But in countries like DPRK, the second-place is the first loser-place. They all expected to be champions."" That expectation is now starting to create problems within North Korean football. While their insularity has given them some advantages on the sporting stage in the past — being able to train and play in secret, and giving their players as many resources as possible to develop from a young age — that same isolation is now holding them back. As global football evolves, especially on the women's side, the DPRK is falling further behind technically and tactically, with new ideas and systems and strategies not making their way inside the country until months, or even years, later. Players, too, have been disadvantaged by this insularity. Until recently, very few North Koreans — especially those who were born in the country — were ever allowed to play club football abroad. But the association is now recognising that the game is accelerating away from them, so has begun to slowly creak open their door, with a handful of men's national team players now permitted to play club football elsewhere. The national teams' experimentation with foreign coaches such as Gerstner, as well as his WhatsApp friend Anderson, who coached the men's senior team at the time, has been another attempt to introduce global ideas to their local football programs, especially at senior level where physicality is no longer the sole determinant of success. But as they slowly open themselves up to the football world, North Korea risks loosening its white-knuckle grip on its own image and its own people, especially those who become more exposed to life beyond the curtain. The country is therefore caught between these two places: wanting to continue challenging on the international sporting stage, but not wanting to step too far outside of itself and potentially shatter the image it has spent decades building. What will this mean for the future of the North Korean game? Gerstner doesn't know. And he hasn't hung around to find out. The German resigned from his role in 2018 to take up a role back home, though he still keeps an eye on the women's national teams from afar. He watched with pride as the players he coached defeated Mexico and Brazil to reach the quarter-final of the 2018 Women's World Cup. Some of them have since made the jump to the senior team, which went on to win the Cyprus Women's Cup in 2019, poetically defeating Italy in the final. But then the pandemic shut them down. Three long, silent years passed, with North Korea withdrawing from all competitions and cancelling all games. Nobody spoke to or heard from anyone inside the federation during this time. The single email address never responded. It's not known what happened to the players in the meantime: how they trained, played, or prepared for their return back to international sport. All we know is that they did something, because they came back with a bang, finishing with a silver medal at least year's Asian Games despite lasting almost an entire World Cup cycle with no global competition. And this week could be the biggest opportunity yet for North Korea to test the limits of their interiority as their women's team faces Japan in a two-legged qualifying play-off for the Paris Olympics. If they win, they'll make their first Games since that controversial 2012 tournament in London: the year that saw their women's national team begin its slow slide before falling totally out of sight. But if they lose, they'll return to North Korea and face whatever consequences await. And the curtain will be drawn back across them once again.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/inside-north-korea-footballs-most-secretive-womens-national-team/103427288
ts38,"Warning: This article contains images some readers may find distressing.  Dairy farming is tough at the best of times, but operating in a war zone with bombs raining down on you and the risk of unexploded ordnance detonating beneath your tractor shows extraordinary dedication. For two years, Ukrainian dairy farmers — among Europe's biggest suppliers — have been facing these hellish conditions in their battle to maintain critical milk production while war rages around them. Horrific images of rotting carcasses of cows, of contorted, smouldering remains of tractors, and of paddocks pockmarked with bomb craters show there are many front lines to this invasion by Russia.     Andriy Dykun, president of the Association of Milk Producers of Ukraine, says some dairy workers are trying to diffuse bombs themselves, while others have been drafted into the army to fight for their country.  ""Up to 50 per cent of the dairy industry is lost and up to 200,000 cows have been killed,"" Mr Dykun said. Before the war, Ukraine was a major milk-producing country, ranking ahead of Australia, and producing almost 10 billion litres a year. It will be many years, if ever, before its dairy industry recovers. Mr Dykun says the Russian invasion has affected the dairy sector in many ways. Speaking at the Australian Dairy Conference in Melbourne last week, he showed Australian dairy farmers a harrowing series of photographs, some depicting cows blown apart, burnt to death, or dying from gaping shrapnel wounds. But as shocking as those pictures were, he says the reality is even worse. ""It's not the most horrible pictures, it was like a light version of them,"" he said. ""We have thousands of fields covered in mines, so that's a really big challenge for Ukraine in the future."" Farmers have banded together to import a de-mining machine from America in an attempt to clear their paddocks of landmines. ""As farmers we invested some money into a military roller de-miner … for farmers to use in front of their tractors,"" Mr Dykun said. ""It's better to explode the mines with the roller than with a tractor. ""There is a front for soldiers, and there is a front for farmers."" Mr Dykun says many men previously working on dairy farms are now in the army, leaving those left behind to try to keep farms operating. ""Fifty per cent of employees are mobilised to the army, so if you have 20 men working on your farm, 10 of them are in the army now,"" he said. ""So you need to think what to do more efficiently on your farm and maybe attract more women to work on your farm."" Previously a major exporter of milk products, Ukraine now can't even produce enough milk to meet its own needs. ""We were exporting dairy products before the war, but now we are importing,"" Mr Dykun said. ""But if we stop production, the economy of the country will die."" Mr Dykun says like their Australian counterparts, Ukrainian dairy farmers have experienced times of depressed milk prices that created challenges for the industry, but the Russian invasion has put that frustration into perspective. ""Sometimes we were not happy, because the prices were low, but this is not bad, you were lucky,"" he said.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/ukrainian-dairy-farmers-battle-bombs-to-keep-milk-flowing/103469886
ts39,"A road trip with a sentimental purpose is how Nita Rojewski has marked her 90th birthday celebration, delayed for two years because of COVID-19 travel restrictions. The Tasmanian-born matriarch and more than 30 family members gathered in Tasmania for a journey with destinations important in Mrs Rojewski's life. Charting her life from birth to marriage then a move to Victoria, Mrs Rojewski travelled from Seymour in Victoria to southern Tasmania.  Granddaughter and organiser Kate Bishop said she hoped it would inspire other families to seize the moment and capture elders' memories. For a week, 11 stops and countless memories of life in southern Tasmania, the road trip started with day one of Mrs Rojewski's 92 years with a visit to the hospital where she was born. ""We spent a week just celebrating her life and seeing what the journey was to get her across to Victoria, where we live now,"" Ms Bishop said. ""So, she could show us all the places that she grew up around.""  Born Nita Cowmeadow at the now defunct St Helen's Private Hospital in Hobart, Mrs Rojewski grew up in the rural town of Huonville on a family-run apple and pear orchard. In 1949, she moved to Hobart and worked at the hospital where she was born and later at the Hobart telephone exchange. At the hospital, Mrs Rojewski met the man who would become her husband, Polish migrant Marian Rojewski, through a colleague. The two moved to Melbourne in 1951 before settling in Seymour in 1954.  Mr Rojewski died in 2000, but the couple had 47 married years and five children. The early days of their relationship and marriage, including the pub where they would catch up with friends, featured on the tour of southern Tasmania. A visit to Mrs Rojewski's childhood home was a highlight of the road trip. It was a memorable moment for a homeowner, who threw open the doors to the family despite the house being under renovation. ""[My uncle] basically just knocked on her door and said, 'Look, this is our story' and she opened her home to us,"" Ms Bishop said. ""I think she was a bit overwhelmed when 34 of us turned up that day."" In the family home, Mrs Rojewski's shared stories of a cave she and her siblings would explore behind the house, playing sports with whatever makeshift implements they could find and her sister learning to ride a bike only to become stuck in a fence. In the same town, Mrs Rojewski stood on the steps of the church where she was baptised and married. There, the family heard stories of Mrs Rojewski's father, Charlie, who never wore any other shoes except work boots until his daughter's wedding day.  ""He went out and got himself some new dress boots for the special day,"" Ms Bishop said. ""Nanna still has these boots to this day and plans on being buried with them."" The family plans to keep in touch with the owner of Mrs Rojewski's childhood home, with another visit planned once the house is fully restored. Matching hats and a storytelling rule helped maintain the focus of the trip for the more than 30 family members.   The family was instructed to record any time Mrs Rojewski began telling a story without everyone there. ""She became a bit of a film star over the week,"" Ms Bishop said.  All stories and memories will be included in a booklet Ms Bishop has planned. Ms Bishop urged others to take time to connect with their aging family members. ""I beg you, I implore you to make sure today is the day, not tomorrow or next week,"" Mrs Bishop said. ""To reach out and connect. ""[Make] the most of your time with family because you just never know what's around the corner."" For Mrs Rojewski, the road trip has set a standard for the quality of a granddaughter.  ""No-one could have a better granddaughter than her,"" Mrs Rojewski said.

ts40,"More history for Annabel Sutherland, and Australia's spinners finally join the party as South Africa's resistance falls well short in Perth. Here are five quick hits from the final day of the standalone Test at the WACA. For the past decade-and-a-half, Perry has been one of the first names mentioned in Australian cricket circles when it comes to elite all-rounders. Despite that deserved praise, the inevitable march of time as well as serious hamstring and shoulder injuries have slowed her somewhat in recent years (although she was still nominated for T20 player of 2023 by the ICC). The good news for Australia is, for the third Test in a row, she's been outplayed by her heir apparent, Annabel Sutherland, who finished with 5-30 and a record-breaking 210, becoming the first woman to take five wickets and score 200 runs in a Test. ""So, so special. One for the ages and shows her class,"" Perry told Fox Sports of Sutherland's performance. ""It's hard to believe she's 22 years old the way she bats out there with so much composure and awareness of the game and belief in her own game. ""Her innings was special but equally she contributed with the ball … just a wonderful Test match for her and I'm sure one she'll remember for a very long time."" Delmi Tucker's first meaningful contribution to Test cricket will not be one she wants to remember — a golden duck at the hands of Australia's hero Annabel Sutherland. But she recovered mighty well, claiming the prized scalp of Alyssa Healy with an excellent caught and bowled to dismiss the Australian skipper for 99. However, her best moment came with the bat in her second dig. Her gritty, determined half century was the first by a South African woman in a Test since 2014. She eventually fell for 64 off an impressive 181 balls — only Sutherland has had a longer stay at the crease (256 balls) in this Test. South Africa won't have much to smile about from Perth, but her brilliant innings will definitely be something they can look back on fondly. Do you have a story idea about women in sport?  Email us abcsport5050@your.abc.net.au At 3-13, South Africa — and just about everyone else watching this Test — must have felt the writing was on the wall for a very abrupt ending to this contest. However, Test debutants Tazmin Brits and Delmi Tucker had other ideas. Their 96-run stand for the fourth wicket was a South African women's Test record, beating the 94-run stand between Brenda Williams and Jennifer Gove against New Zealand at the New Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg in 1972. More impressive perhaps for the South Africans was the 245 balls it lasted. A terrific low catch — which needed checking by the third umpire — by Phoebe Litchfield off the bowling of Ellyse Perry ended the partnership, but with it the South Africans restored a bit of much-needed pride. Coming in at number five with her team three wickets down for spit, she was rebuilding her team's innings when all of a sudden she popped a return catch back to an off spinner. No, we're not talking about Alyssa Healy in the first innings, but Delmi Tucker, who dismissed Healy in similar fashion in Australia's innings, only to suffer exactly the same fate in South Africa's second dig. Tucker and Chloe Tryon were carrying on the work she and Tazmin Brits started, when the spin of Ash Gardner brought her undone. Having smothered the South African's scoring after lunch, Healy crammed four close catchers around her to up the pressure stakes on Tucker, who got a leading edge to Gardner, who took a catch eerily reminiscent of that which she accounted for the Australian skipper on 99 on day one. South Africa would not say they were cruising at lunch, but they certainly deserved to feel like they were in a positive mindset at 4-140, losing just 1-73 in that first session, scoring at a run rate of 2.61. However, after lunch, everything slowed down. Sophie Molineux, Ash Gardner and then Alana King brought the scoring to an abrupt halt, piling the pressure back onto the batters. In the 24 overs those three bowled after lunch, South Africa scored just 28 runs — with one boundary. That's a run rate of 1.17. The pressure was building and, eventually, told, with Gardner taking two wickets in a 12-over spell. With King also getting the edge of Chloe Tryon, dropped at slip by Mooney when on 38, the Australian spinners had the ball on a string and the match in their hand. So it was a tad surprising that Alyssa Healy immediately called for the new ball, ending the successful trial by spin.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/australia-vs-south-africa-test-day-three-five-quick-hits/103480336
ts41,"With 10 more lower house seats up for grabs in Tasmania, there's 10 new spaces for fresh voices, new ideas and invigorated partyroom depth. There's also spaces for experienced heads, seasoned campaigners and lifelong party stalwarts. In this election, the parties have, so far at least, leaned somewhat towards the latter. For the Liberal Party, former senator and federal cabinet minister Eric Abetz is aiming to resurrect his political career after 28 years in Canberra. He's contesting the southern seat of Franklin, alongside another well-known figure in Tasmanian politics, Jacquie Petrusma. Just over 18 months ago, she stood down from parliament as a Liberal MP after 12 years ""due to personal and family reasons"", but now says she's ""looking forward to working hard"" as she seeks a comeback. Her time in politics has included two unsuccessful tilts to enter the Senate as a Family First candidate, and she was first promoted to former premier Will Hodgman's cabinet in 2014. As of Sunday evening, the Liberals have only announced four candidates, along with their incumbent MPs. The candidates also include Kingborough councillor Aldo Antolli and Meander Valley deputy mayor Stephanie Cameron – both prior unsuccessful candidates. And upper house MLC Jane Howlett has Premier Jeremy Rockliff's endorsement to run for the Liberals in Lyons, making it five from five for candidates returning to the well. They are expected to announce the remaining candidates within days, including former Southern Cross sports presenter Rob Fairs for Bass. He'll be aiming to join other former television personalities Jo Palmer and Nick Duigan, in the Liberal partyroom. Labor also has a smattering of experienced heads across its ticket. Five of its 20 candidates – excluding incumbents – have stood for the party before. Upper house MLC Josh Willie is running in Clark, while former Legislative Council candidate and Huon Valley deputy mayor Toby Thorpe is having a crack at Franklin. They are considered among Labor's best chances of picking up additional seats. Former federal candidates Simon Davis and Chris Lynch are running for the lower house, having missed in Clark and Braddon at the most recent federal election. Three more candidates are on local councils. But Labor has also been able to secure the first-time candidacy of several high-profile community members. John Kamara escaped war-torn Sierra Leone as a 19-year-old, and was last year named Tasmania's Australian of the Year. He will be running in Clark, and said the parliament needed to better represent the whole community. ""The parliament now is very white,"" Mr Kamara said. ""Tasmania is becoming so diverse … you walk in the street and you see so much diversity, but it's not represented in our leadership. ""Families like mine are doing it very tough, very tough in our community. Whatever changes have been made, hasn't been for some of us."" Labor has also announced Launceston General Hospital nurse Will Gordon for Bass. Mr Gordon was the whistleblower who exposed the hospital's failure to remove paedophile nurse James Geoffrey Griffin. This was a key precursor that led to the commission of inquiry into child sexual abuse. The Greens have a familiar look. Their lead candidates for each seat have all run before – Cecily Rosol in Bass, Tabatha Badger in Lyons who previously ran for the Senate, and Darren Briggs, who ran federally in Braddon. The party is targeting the balance of power, and would be hoping to secure four seats in the expanded parliament, retaining a seat each in Franklin and Clark and adding Lyons and Bass as its best chance. The crossbench could also feature other well-known Tasmanian political identities having another crack. Former Labor leader David O'Byrne is running as an independent in Franklin, and former Liberal and independent speaker Sue Hickey is contesting Clark. Both had their fair share of attention in the past two terms of parliament – Ms Hickey as the trigger for the last election, and Mr O'Byrne in the spotlight in the election's immediate aftermath. University of Tasmania associate professor of public and environmental policy Kate Crowley said the major parties had a long lead-in to the election, so should have had a fresh batch of candidates ready to go. But she said the public's perception of the major parties could be changing. ""We are seeing a trend around the country where major parties are more on the nose with the electorate, and potential candidates know that and think, 'maybe I'll run as an independent, maybe I'll approach Jacqui Lambie',"" Associate Professor Crowley said. On top of this, Tasmanian politicians are on the same pay as they were in 2018, which is potentially a factor in the difficulties in finding new talent to fill the lower house benches.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/familiar-candidates-rear-heads-tasmanian-election/103476268
ts42,"In recent weeks, key members of Australia's last generation of true economic reformers have been speaking up with urgency about the poor state of our economy. Professor Ross Garnaut, former Treasury secretary Ken Henry and former competition tsars Allan Fels and Rod Sims have each been in the news lately. All were deeply involved in the reform era of the 1980s and 1990s, when the Hawke and Keating Labor governments restructured Australia's economy to drag it out of a period of stagnation. And now, decades later, they're ringing alarm bells again. ""Why are you hearing more of these older voices? Because we've just had the worst decade ever for economic performance in Australia's history,"" Garnaut told me last week. ""This last decade, starting in 2013, was the first decade in our history where real wages were — on average — lower at the end than at the beginning. You can't find any other 10 years since Federation where that has happened. ""That's why old people like us feel like we can't keep quiet. It's a catastrophe."" Garnaut, with Professor Rod Sims, delivered an important speech at the National Press Club last week and unveiled a big new idea. They are both directors of a new think-tank, The Superpower Institute, which Garnaut founded to change the narrative about climate change and Australia's economy.  Garnaut was principal economic adviser to prime minister Bob Hawke from 1983 to 1985, as was Sims from 1988 to 1990. They both say our national debate about what a low-carbon future will look like has been too focused on what Australia will lose from the energy transition, as the world's largest exporter of gas and coal taken together. They say we're forgetting to think of the huge advantages Australia will enjoy in a low-emissions future, given we have the world's best combination of solar and wind energy resources and some of the world's largest resources of the critical minerals needed for the energy transition. They say we'll gain immensely from manufacturing green iron, green aluminium, green transport fuels, green urea and green silicon, and it will make economic sense to manufacture those products in Australia for export using the world's cheapest renewable energy. They say the economics of commodity exports and manufacturing will be flipped on their head in the new world, to Australia's great advantage. ""Australia can have more employment and higher incomes in the relatively short term, and be much richer in the longer term, by moving early and decisively in building and expanding the zero emissions superpower export economy,"" they say. ""If Australia seizes the opportunity, it can repeat the experience of the China resources boom which peaked around 10 years ago. But this time the opportunity can be sustained, rather than boom and bust, and we can manage it better for broadly based development."" Which brings us to their big idea. In their Press Club address last week, Garnaut and Sims said policymakers could help to transition Australia's economy into an advantageous low-emissions future by placing a ""carbon solutions levy"" on this country's fossil fuel extraction sites from 2030-31, at the same level as the European Union carbon price (about $90 a tonne of carbon dioxide). They said such a levy would initially raise more than $100 billion in revenue a year, declining slowly as fossil fuels exited Australia's economy over time, and that money could be used to underwrite Australia's renewable energy transition while over-compensating households, slashing electricity bills by $440 a year and removing all petrol and diesel excise, and significantly lowering inflation. ""Our main message today is that export of zero-carbon goods can underpin a long period of high investment, rising productivity, full employment and rising incomes in Australia,"" Garnaut told the audience. ""The superpower transformation can put us back on a path to higher productivity and living standards after a lost decade."" But he also predicted how the current generation of politicians would respond to his idea. ""We expect that the established political parties will rule out this suggestion,"" Garnaut said. ""That is the way ideas for efficiency-raising reform are discussed in contemporary Australia. [But] that will not be the end of the matter. If there is continued community interest and growing support, political leaders will come back to it."" And then there's former Treasury secretary Ken Henry, who has also been warning about the state of things. Dr Henry was the last person to subject Australia's tax system to a root-and-branch review, back in 2008-09. The final report from his tax review was published in 2010, and it made 138 recommendations — a wish list of tax reforms to set Australia up for the 21st century — but few were implemented and two of those that were introduced in some form were later repealed. Last week, he warned that our tax system had deteriorated to the point that he was worried about Australia's ""social compact"" holding together. ""We're in a worse position now than we were 15 years ago when we were writing the review,"" Dr Henry told the ABC.  ""It's an intergenerational tragedy that we have allowed this to happen."" Henry was an economic adviser to Labor treasurer Paul Keating from 1986 to 1991, and served as an Australian representative to the OECD from 1992 to 1994. He said tax reform took time, and it helped to be extremely patient when calling for reform if you wanted to keep your sanity. He said many of the big tax reforms of the 1980s and 1990s had their genesis in the Asprey Review of 1975, with the GST being one of them, introduced by Liberal prime minister John Howard in 2000, 25 years after it was recommended by Kenneth Asprey. He said he was under no illusions about the time it took for true tax reform to occur in this country. But even still, he said, he was despairing about the condition our tax system had fallen into, as successive governments had failed to adapt the system to huge changes that had occurred in the global economy this century. He said intergenerational unfairness had now become embedded in the tax system, and housing, the state of climate policy, and the Commonwealth's over-reliance on taxing workers' incomes were three areas of major policy failure. He said workers were now shouldering far more of the tax burden than they were 15 years ago because other taxes had been generating less revenue over time. ""The only Commonwealth tax that is growing as a share of GDP is personal income tax,"" he said. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Professor Allan Fels published an 80-page report, commissioned by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, on the pricing practices of Australia's largest companies. Professor Fels said Australia's modern economy had become dominated by a huge number of extremely powerful companies that were exploiting their market power to rip off customers and kill competition, and governments were not paying the issue enough attention. I asked Professor Garnaut why key members of the older generation of economic reformers were increasingly speaking up these days. He said he belonged to a generation of economists who had been encouraged by their professors, while students, to contribute to democratic civil life. ""I grew up in an environment of economics in which interest in public policy, thinking through the current issues, was seen as being central to the job of an economist,"" he said. ""I was at the ANU with people like Nugget Coombs and John Crawford and the next generation like Heinz Arndt and Max Corden, who encouraged that sort of thing."" One of those men, John Crawford (1910-1984), was a pioneering advocate in Australia of the belief that good democratic government relied on a quality bureaucracy, with top public servants and officials performing a vital function, like ""statesmen in disguise"", who could make welfare-enhancing contributions to policy as trained analysts and advisers. Garnaut said there were some younger economists doing good public policy work in Australia today, but he felt something had changed in Australia in recent decades, including within the media, and the quality of our national conversation about policy wasn't as good as it used to be, and it was undermining our politics and economic performance. ""The causation runs two ways,"" he said. ""One of the reasons for our political instability over the last decade has been a grumpy electorate, because incomes have stagnated. Ordinary people are doing it tough. They know they can't get a house as easily as their parents did and it makes them grumpy. ""It's really extraordinary that the longest term a prime minister has had since 2007 is three years. There were a few duds amongst those prime ministers but they weren't all duds, and I think the grumpy electorate from the poor economic performance and worsening income distribution of the last decade has put some tension in society that's contributing to our political instability, and the political instability itself contributes to bad policy,"" he said. So, I asked, if politicians seized the opportunity to turn Australia into a renewable energy ""superpower"", as he's suggesting, could that fix our problems with declining real incomes, inflation, and deteriorating living standards? ""And will our democracy start working better and we'll get better policy?"" Garnaut asked in reply. ""Yes, I really think that. That's what we're hoping,"" he said.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/can-these-economists-turn-things-around-for-younger-australians/103480052
ts43,"NSW Premier Chris Minns says his decision to give up alcohol two years ago has been life-changing. As the debate continues about politicians drinking after Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce was filmed talking on a mobile phone while lying on a Canberra footpath, Mr Minns revealed he had stuck with his pre-election decision to stop drinking. ""I haven't had anything to drink for a couple of years now,"" Mr Minns told ABC Radio Sydney. ""I probably was leaning on it too much during COVID and I mentioned it to my wife that I might get off it for a while and I was surprised that she said, 'I think that's a good idea'. ""So I thought I'd try it for a month, and maybe six months but in the end for me it ended up being life-changing like a massive positive change to my life."" He joked he was about to bring in prohibition in NSW — a reference to the prohibition era in the United States where the production, importation and sale of alcohol was banned between 1920 and 1933. ""My staff keep worrying I'm going to say that, no I'm joking, but for me, it was a good decision."" Mr Joyce said he fell off a planter box while talking on the phone after attending functions at Parliament House in Canberra. He told Channel 7 on Monday that he had given up alcohol for the 40 days of Lent in the lead-up to Easter. Mr Minns stopped short of supporting drug and alcohol testing for MPs, something teal independent MP Zali Steggall raised after Mr Joyce's behaviour. Mr Minns also did not think it would be practical to halt the sale of wine and beer at NSW Parliament House which hosts many functions involving community groups. ""It's difficult to say we're not going to have any alcohol sold in the building because as a result community groups wouldn't have access to the facilities,"" he said. His advice to colleagues was simple: ""Don't drink at work"". Sober Awkward podcast co-host Victoria Vanstone said she sent the premier an email when she first heard him open up about his sobriety in a previous interview. ""We're so entrenched in this culture where at every work do we get absolutely wasted, so it was lovely to see him talking about it so openly on the TV,"" she said. Ms Vanstone said a lot of people were reconsidering their relationship with booze because it was having a negative impact on their lives. ""There's this place that exists between the pub and an AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) meeting,"" she said. ""People that are questioning their alcohol intake, with a hangover or just generally in their life and it's called being sober curious. ""We're not talking about extreme alcoholism, we're not talking about maybe one glass a year, there's a massive space in the middle which is called grey-area drinking where a lot of people fit in."" Ms Vanstone said Mr Joyce's commitment to stop drinking for 40 days was enough time to feel the benefits of a sober lifestyle. ""I think in that period he will find that his skin will get better, his brain will start working, he'll be much more functional at work, his relationships will get better, he can go out without being weird and acting in a strange way.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/chris-minns-sober-two-years-barnaby-joyce-alcohol-lent/103484580
ts44,"The study is considered a world first, with researchers using Australian Bureau of Statistics data and a nationally representative sample of 16,000 people to study the country's smoking population. If you were asked to picture a typical smoker, you might come up with the following stereotypes: someone who is unemployed, uneducated, Indigenous, and suffering poor mental health. But research — considered world-first — from the Australian National University (ANU) has debunked those common myths. While smoking rates were higher among those groups, the research found most daily smokers were actually employed, educated and in good mental health. Researchers used Australian Bureau of Statistics data and a nationally representative sample of 16,000 people to study the country's smoking population. They found of the 2.5 million people who smoke daily in Australia, 60 per cent were male, 65 per cent live in major cities and 92 per cent did not identify as Indigenous. Furthermore, 69 per cent of smokers had completed year 12, while 69 per cent of those of working age were in paid employment. And 73 per cent had good mental health. The research also found that 54 per cent of smokers lived in the bottom two socio-economic quintiles. Epidemiologist Professor Emily Banks, who was the senior author on the study, said the lack of understanding meant the majority of smokers didn't see themselves reflected in current anti-smoking campaigns. ""We know from other studies that certain groups in the population are over-represented among smokers,"" Professor Banks explained. ""We know that people who smoke are more likely to be unemployed than people who don't smoke, they're more likely to be homeless and they're more likely to be less educated. ""We also know that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are more likely to smoke than non-Aboriginal people."" However, Professor Banks said it was important to distinguish between people being over-represented in the smoking population and what that general population looked like. ""The majority of smokers are really very like the general population of Australia,"" she said. Professor Banks said a big takeaway from the research was to stop thinking about smoking as a problem for ""other people"" and instead to view it as a problem for the general community. She said there was a tendency to stigmatise smokers rather than view smoking as a public health issue. ""[Most] people who smoke started as children and adolescents, and the vast majority want to quit,"" Professor Banks said. ""So, it's not like it's sort of a personal choice when we've got long-term adult smokers who often have a lot of difficulty quitting."" Professor Banks said those devising anti-smoking campaigns needed to think about where harm reduction measures were best focused. Tackling Indigenous smoking rates and addressing those who smoked with poor mental health was already on the table. But researchers hope the new study will inform additional measures going forward and ensure smoking isn't perceived as an issue which only affects disadvantaged groups. ""It's really important that people who smoke kind of see themselves in all of the publicity and all of the campaigns,"" Professor Banks said. ""They really need to be able to identify with the materials in order to be empowered and supported to quit."" Professor Banks urged action on tackling smoking, given it remained Australia's leading cause of premature death and disability. She was concerned by the perception smoking had been ""tackled"" given its prevalence continued to decline. ""We have around 20,000 deaths each year in Australia from smoking, and every single family, every single person has lost a loved one to smoking,"" Professor Banks said. She said both smoking and vaping were challenges which needed to be tackled head on. That is something Laura Hunter, co-chief executive officer of the Australian Council on Smoking and Health, would also like to see happen.  ""From an Australian perspective, [the research] is a critical piece of the puzzle when we think about how we as a country are going to achieve the goals that are currently set out in the National Tobacco Strategy,"" Ms Hunter said.  The current smoking rate in Australia was about 12 per cent and the federal government's National Tobacco Strategy commits to reducing daily smoking prevalence to below 10 per cent by 2025, and 5 per cent or less by 2030. ""These are very ambitious goals and they need ambitious interventions,"" Ms Hunter said.  She said she was closely watching the implementation of the government's new tobacco control legislation passed in December. ""When you're trying to reduce smoking, you need to come at it from a number of fronts,"" she said.  ""You need taxes on tobacco, you need effective, sound campaigns, you need bans on advertising, and looking at that tobacco retail licensing area, and smoke-free areas. ""At the end of the day, we know that the tobacco industry is at fault here and they are relentless on all fronts in that space."" ",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/anu-smoking-study-debunks-smoker-stereotypes/103481706
ts45,"At just 17, Australian middle-distance prodigy Cameron Myers displays maturity that is just as impressive as his outstanding performances on the track have been during the past 12 months. This was evident during Thursday night's Maurie Plant Meet at Melbourne's Lakeside Stadium, when the Canberran lined up for the prestigious John Landy Mile. Among the field was Great Britain's Jake Wightman, who won the 1,500 metres at the 2022 World Athletics Championships in Eugene, and Tasmanian Stewart McSweyn, a finalist in the ""metric mile"" at the Tokyo Olympics. Myers refused to be intimidated by the quality of his rivals, while he showed poise during the early jostling for position that is common in the middle-distance events. He used his smooth running form to put himself in contention for victory alongside McSweyn and Wightman in the final 50 metres when the race came down to a desperate sprint. The greater experience of McSweyn and Wightman came to the fore as they finished first and second in 3:52.00 and 3:52.11 respectively, but Myers was not far off in third place after posting a personal-best time of 3:52.44. Myers smashed the national under 20 record of 3:55.44 he set at the same meet last February when he became the second youngest athlete in track and field history — behind Norway's reigning Olympic 1,500m champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen — to break the four-minute mile barrier. The weight of expectation can be a heavy burden for any young athlete to carry, but Myers went from strength to strength during his 2023 overseas campaign while juggling year 11 studies at Lake Ginninderra College. Last July, when making his Diamond League debut in the 1,500m against the likes of Ingebrigtsen in Chorzów, Myers ran a PB of 3:33.26, which went down in the record books as the world under 18 best performance over the distance. It also broke the Australian under 18 and 20 records and gave Myers a qualifying time for the World Athletics Championships, which were being held in Budapest the following month. Myers, though, chose not to compete at the world titles, instead returning to Australia to focus on preparing for the 2024 Olympic season. His effort in Chorzów meant he already had an Olympic qualifier under his belt and the extended off-season appears to be paying off. Aside from his performance in Melbourne, Myers won the 1,500m at last weekend's Adelaide Invitational in 3:34.55, the second-fastest time he has run. Giving up the chance to make his world championships debut illustrated the mature approach Myers is taking. He knew he would be better off returning to the training track in his pursuit of a berth on Australia's team for the Paris Olympics. ""Last year I was lacking a little bit of that strength that these guys would have over the longer distances,"" Myers told ABC Sport at the Maurie Plant Meet. ""So working on that weakness is really showing now and I'm happy."" A lack of fear when facing world-class competition is another aspect of Myers's make-up as an athlete that suggests he may become one of Australia's middle-distance greats. He thrived on the opportunity to race in Melbourne against Wightman, who will be among the medal contenders in Paris if fully fit after experiencing an injury-marred 2023 season. ""I want to get into those bigger meets and start competing on the world stage against the best,"" Myers said. ""So having a guy like Jake here is always good to test the fitness and see where I'm at."" Beyond the domestic season, Myers — who trains under revered coach Dick Telford — will head overseas for races in the United States, before basing himself in Germany. He is one of three Australians to have run an Olympic qualifier in the 1,500m — the other two being McSweyn and Adam Spencer — but is not guaranteed a spot in the team for Paris, with the selection process still to play out. An Olympic debut this year would be a well-deserved achievement, however Myers — who turns 18 in June — still has the Los Angeles (2028) and Brisbane (2032) Games to look forward to when he will be closer to the peak of his career. ""I'm improving as an athlete and I'm getting better year on year,"" Myers said.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/australia-track-and-field-cameron-myers-paris-olympics-prospects/103481570
ts46,"Atefa Mohseni's life was going to plan in 2021. The 25-year-old had just completed her degree, was working in her chosen field of pharmacy, and, most importantly, she was free to choose what she did with her life next. That all changed in August of that year when Kabul fell to the Taliban. Overnight, Ms Mohseni's freedom was curtailed dramatically. ""I loved my job, I loved my field, and everything, suddenly everything just gone, just in one night,"" she said. ""I was working in Kabul University and now girls can't go to school, universities for girls closed."" She, along with her parents and sister's family, were evacuated to Australia on protective visas within a couple of months.  But leaving her country with nothing more than a suitcase was extremely challenging for the now 27-year-old who felt like she left her identity behind as well. ""I remember the first day I came to Australia, I was crying because I couldn't speak even a word of English,"" Ms Mohseni explained. Now settled in Sydney, Ms Mohseni is hopeful of completing her studies in community services at TAFE and starting a degree. But for her parents, particularly her father, it's been even more difficult. Her dad has suffered depression since the family relocated here and he continues to hold out hope of returning to Afghanistan one day. That's hope Ms Mohseni doesn't share. ""Australia is a safe country for me .. if I'm here and I make my future here, I'll be more useful for my country,"" she said. Her life, now, is here. Zahra Karimi understands the situation Ms Mohseni is in because she's experienced it too. Ms Karimi was an activist, a scholar and a teacher in Kabul before the Taliban takeover. ""Things weren't perfect but they were functional,"" she explained. She openly criticised the government at the time and its policies and worked with an organisation dedicated to fighting for women's rights. But her safety was jeopardised after the takeover, and she reached out to international contacts to be evacuated.  Ms Karimi remembered the day after the takeover most vividly — putting on a Taliban-approved outfit and being unable to recognise herself in the mirror. ""It was just unbelievable that I suddenly lost everything I knew myself to be able to do,"" she said. Now, Ms Karimi is settled in Melbourne and working at Monash University.  In trying to leave Afghanistan, both women found help securing visas and documentation from an unlikely place — Canberra. Specifically, it was the organisation Azadi-e Zan (Free Woman), whose executive director is Canberra's Susan Hutchinson, which was able to support their safe passage to Australia. Thanks to the advocacy of Ms Hutchinson, a tireless advocate for women's rights, the network has been able to evacuate more than 300 women's rights defenders from Afghanistan. Ms Hutchinson previously worked for NGOs and the military, but now volunteers her time as a social justice advocate due to her chronic disabling illness. Of course, more women remain in Afghanistan where their rights have been dramatically curtailed. That's why Ms Hutchinson and around 25 of the women she helped, have descended on Canberra this week to, as they put it, ""pay it forward"". They are cooking traditional Afghani foods like dumplings, kebabs and flatbreads to sell at the capital's famous Multicultural Festival to raise money to support those who may need to leave in the future. That's an expensive task at the moment, with visas and passports costing thousands of dollars a person. ""It feels like the world has forgotten the women of Afghanistan,"" Ms Hutchinson said. ""But so many of us continue to work really hard for those women who have fought … and there's so many of them who are still fighting very hard, despite what many of us would consider the absolute nightmare scenario."" It's also the first time many of the women have been able to meet each other since escaping as part of the network.  ""Often people think that as a refugee, to have made it out is to be lucky,"" Ms Hutchinson said. ""But it is so traumatic for people, you know, they have left so much behind."" As for those who continue the fight from within, they are never far from the minds of women like Ms Karimi and Ms Mohseni. ""Small acts of resistance in everything. The women back in my country are still resisting,"" Ms Karimi said. ""They're fighting for their rights. And they're fighting for those rights with their lives.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/womens-rights-defenders-in-canberra-after-fleeing-taliban/103477098

Career highlights * Now known as the Verry Elleegant Stakes ** Now known as the King Charles III Stakes Verry Ellegant had moved to France in 2022 to continue her racing career, but was retired later that year before beginning a new career as a broodmare. Connections confirmed on Monday the mare had died following complications giving birth. She was in foal to superstar stallion Sea The Stars, who won a string of big global races including the 2,000 Guineas in England, the English Derby, the Eclipse Stakes, Irish Champion Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. The foal, which would have been her first, did not survive. Verry Elleegant — trained for almost her entire career by Waller — won the 2020 Caulfield Cup, the 2021 Melbourne Cup defeating Incentivise and was named the 2020/2021 Australasian Horse of the Year. Waller posted a statement on social media on behalf of the ownership group. ""It is incredibly sad that we pass on the news … that Verry Elleegant has passed away due to complications giving birth to her foal,"" Waller's statement read. ""The news is just filtering through to stable staff and other close connections who are coming to terms with this tragic news. ""She was in fantastic hands on a farm who did all they could for her, and we would like to thank them for their efforts which we will be forever grateful for. ""We all saw the courage she had on the racetrack over many seasons, and she will never be forgotten by those close to her as well as the wider racing public who followed her career and loved her so much.""

""I thought I was just having a bit of fun in a dress up competition ... certainly things have gone a bit crazy,"" Mr Rose said. Mr Rose said it was an unofficial event and he thought the decision to dress up would not be taken too seriously. ""I didn't set out to offend anyone and I'm sorry if I overstepped the mark, but I was just having a bit of a laugh and I think if you can't have a bit of fun in sport then there's no point in doing it.

ts49,"Yashasvi Jaiswal became only the third Indian batsman to score consecutive Test double hundreds as India completed a record 434-run win against England in the third Test on Sunday. Jaiswal was 214 not out – following on from his 209 in Visakhapatnam – as India declared at 4-430 (98 overs) in its second innings, thus setting the touring side an improbable 557 runs for victory. England was then routed for 122 runs (39.4 overs) in just over one session, falling to its heaviest Test defeat (by runs) since World War II. Ravindra Jadeja picked up 5-41 to bowl India to what seemed an unlikely day-four win, as the hosts took a 2-1 lead in the five-Test series. India won the second test by 106 runs after England beat the hosts by 28 runs in the opener. It was India's biggest Test win by runs. Its previous best came in a 372-run victory over New Zealand at Mumbai in 2021. ""When you are playing Test cricket, it is not played over two-three days,"" said Indian skipper Rohit Sharma. ""We do understand the importance of playing over five days. England played well and put us under pressure (on days one and two). I am really proud of how we came back the next day. The message was to stay calm because we have got class in our bowling attack."" Post lunch, Jaiswal followed in the footsteps of Vinod Kambli (1993) and Virat Kohli (2017) as he scored a magnificent double hundred off 231 balls. He added 172 runs off only 158 balls with Sarfaraz Khan, who scored a second consecutive half-century in his debut match. It was an exceptional hitting performance from the two young batters as India scored 116 runs in just 16 overs at more than seven runs per over. Jaiswal smashed five more sixes – including a hat trick off James Anderson – taking his innings tally to 12. It was the most sixes hit by an Indian batter in a Test innings. For his part, Khan hit three sixes, bringing up his half-century off 65 balls. He finished with 68 not out off 72 balls. It was a complete change of gears from the morning session when India scored 118 runs in 31 overs. Shubman Gill was run out for 91, while night watchman Kuldeep Yadav had scored 27 runs, as India reached 314-4 at lunch. Jaiswal, who had retired hurt in the evening of day three after scoring 104 runs, returned thereafter to plunder the English bowling attack. At 22 years and 52 days, he became the third youngest batter after Kambli (21 years 54 days) and Australia's Don Bradman (21 years 318 days) to score consecutive test double hundreds. Faced with a monstrous target, England collapsed under the weight of expectation. It was down to 28-4 in 11.1 overs, and then 50-7 in 24.4 overs. It went to tea at 18-2 from 8.2 overs – first innings' centurion Ben Duckett was run out following a mix up, while his partner Zack Crawley was out lbw to Jasprit Bumrah (1-18). To make matters worse for England, Ravichandran Ashwin returned to take the field after tea. The off-spinner, who had claimed his 500th Test wicket on day two, had flown home to Chennai thereafter for a family medical emergency. He returned to Rajkot on the morning of day four. Jadeja then wreaked havoc after the final break of the day's play. First, he sent Ollie Pope back for three, out caught at slip, and then trapped Jonny Bairstow lbw for four in consecutive overs. Joe Root and Ben Stokes added 22 runs, but the fight had gone from England. Jadeja trapped Root lbw for seven in the 22nd over, and then Kuldeep Yadav dismissed Stokes in the same manner six balls later. Stokes made 15 runs. Yadav made it seven-down as Rehan Ahmed skied a catch to long on for a five-ball duck. Mark Wood and Tom Hartley threw their bats around to add a few runs to England's total, taking it across 100. Hartley scored 16, before Ashwin bowled him, finishing with 1-19 from six overs. Jadeja then sealed India's win as Wood was caught at long off, securing the double of a five-wicket haul and scoring a century in the same Test for a second time in his career. The all-rounder was named player of the match at his home ground. ""I was just looking to build partnerships with Rohit (Sharma), when we were in a difficult situation in the first innings,"" he said. ""I try to watch the ball and play it accordingly. I know about this ground that it is always good to bat here first and then it spins in the second half of the match. You won't get easy wickets and you have to earn them."" It was England's second biggest defeat by runs in Test cricket after losing by 562 runs against Australia in 1934. ""Sometimes gameplans don't work and that was the case here,"" said Stokes, after the loss. ""We are 1-2 down in the series and it is a great opportunity for us to come back and win the series. We will leave this game behind, knowing we have to win two games to win it."" The fourth Test begins in Ranchi on Friday.

ts50,"Isaac Cooper and the women's 4x100 metre medley relay team have ensured Australia finished the World Aquatics Championships on a high, winning two gold medals on the final night in Doha to bring their tally to seven. Cooper put previous heartbreak behind him to top the podium in the men's 50m backstroke. He was soon followed by the women's 4x100m medley relay team who claimed the final gold of the meet to confirm the Dolphins' third place on the medal table. With seven golds, 12 silver and five bronze, Australia's 24-medal tally was only exceeded by China (33, with 23 gold). The USA won more golds (nine) among a 23-medal haul that also included six silvers and eight bronzes. Sam Williamson, in the 50m breaststroke, claimed Australia's other gold in the pool. Cooper stunned world-record holder Hunter Armstrong of the USA, leading from the start to beat the defending champion by 0.2 seconds. Poland's Ksawery Masiuk was third. The Queenslander even survived hitting the lane rope multiple times on his way to claiming the title in 24.13. ""I told my coach I would love a go at going under 24 (seconds) tonight but I whacked my finger a couple of times … the roof is curved … so it was a bit of a mind game to swim straight,"" Cooper said. ""I am really proud of that swim … I have no idea what I am capable of, but it's up to the individual to test it. ""This event isn't on the Olympic program so my goal is to now focus on 100 back, and the 50m free. ""I would love to one day become the fastest man in the world — whether it happens this year or in 10 years. ""But I also know my country needs me for the backstroke, in the relays, so I'm training for that as well."" It is the first individual win at a global championships for the Bundaberg swimmer, who was devastated to miss out on solo gold at the short-course world titles in Melbourne in 2022. There he won two relay golds but a fiasco in the 50m backstroke final, which he won but was forced to re-race after a starting mix up, cost him personal glory. ""All I want to do is be able to stand on top. Every time I get close, I get knocked back again,"" Cooper, who ended up with the silver medal in Melbourne, said at the time. ""If I can come back from this I know I will be a better person and athlete."" Come back he has, earning his reward in Qatar where he had already collected silver as part of Australia's mixed medley relay team. Cooper received his medal immediately before Shayna Jack made her assault on the women's 50m freestyle. His fellow Queenslander was unable to follow his lead, finishing fourth in 24.27 in a race won by 50m butterfly gold medallist Sarah Sjoestroem. Jack soon bounced back, though, producing a stunning final leg in the 4x100 relay to take Australia to first place after Iona Anderson, Brianna Throssell and Abbey Harkin had laid the platform. These were Jack and Throssell's sixth medals of the eight-day campaign, and Harkin's fifth. ""Every single girl here did their job, that's why we are number one,"" Jack said. ""(Australia) are in a great position (heading into Paris).""

ts51,"It's a hot February evening in Melbourne/Naarm, and the rays of sunshine glancing off thousands of sequins is almost blinding. It's Taylor Swift Day. There has been a hum in the air from the start, a feeling that everyone in the city is tilting their bodies slightly towards the MCG, just waiting for the moment when she will finally take the stage. Well, that's the folklore, anyway. And it's certainly true for the young fans who huddled in blankets to see her private jet touching down just before 1am on Thursday. It's why people spent thousands of dollars to come to the show — a young Perth woman of no more than 20 details the long list of expenses that she copped to get here: ""I'd go anywhere to see Taylor,"" she says. We'll find out later there are 96,000 people here — the largest turnout to the Eras global tour so far, Taylor tells us — and almost every single person is decked out. Bulging pink clusters of people are gathered on every corner, practically jumping up and down with excitement. Fans with friendship bracelets from wrist to elbow adjust their shiny skirts and tops and animatedly speculate about what the two secret songs will be (more on that later). I love a lot of Taylor's music, but the breathless furore in the build-up to her arrival had me feeling a bit sceptical. How could one woman, albeit a very rich and talented one, possibly live up to all the hype? But within five minutes of her explosive arrival on the stage, I thought to myself: She's going to do it. Thanks to the wall-to-wall coverage of her shows around the world so far — and the release of the Eras concert film in October — most of us know the premise of this tour. It covers 10 albums the star has released, from 2008's Fearless, to 2022's Midnights. We also knew that she would start with the Lover era — the one awash in candy pink, featuring such bangers as You Need to Calm Down. And it doesn't disappoint, particularly her acoustic version of title track Lover, featuring a pale pink guitar and pastel-clad dancers whirling around her in ecstatic pairs. But it's when she transitions into her second era — Fearless — that she really hits her stride. The key change in classic teen track Love Story has the crowd screaming and jumping like they're in a mosh pit. The songs keep coming, the giant screens behind the stage offering videos and voice-overs while Taylor does a lightning-fast costume change. The breaks are negligible, and before you know it Taylor is back, her red lipstick perfect. There's something a bit like musical theatre in the way this show runs, particularly the props and stage design. The folklore era — one of two woodsy albums Taylor released during the pandemic — opens with her lying dreamily on the roof of an actual cabin, smoke puffing from the chimney. In Midnights, the dancers each have small individual ladders with a fluffy white cloud at the top. During the track Vigilante Shit, the troupe and Taylor writhe and dance on chairs in powerful unison (another musical theatre staple, and perhaps a welcome moment where she actually gets to sit down for a second). For the Evermore era she appears in a long yellow dress and green velvet cape, the dancers carrying glowing orange balls. It's a strong witchy mood, and Taylor leans into it, swirling her cape theatrically. The show is cheesier than I expected it to be, in a way that's endearing. Taylor doesn't act like the most famous woman on the planet; she sticks out her tongue and does over-the-top mimes that match her lyrics, hamming it up the whole time. And making it clear that she doesn't take herself too seriously allows her to get away with her more earnest moments — and things like having a moss-covered grand piano and a wooden microphone. ""I want to hear 96,000 people sing Champagne Problems with me,"" she says in front of said piano during the evermore era, where the crowd heartily joins in, and then spends about three whole minutes afterwards cheering and chanting her name. Covering 10 albums in one show is no small feat, and it requires almost three-and-a-half hours to do it. At times, the continuous gear shifts feel a bit jarring, whipping away from an era just when it feels like it's hitting its stride. But then she plays the opening notes of the next hit, and you're pulled right back in. The folklore era drags a little, perhaps because it's a slower album and comes in the latter half of the show, when everyone's feet are starting to get tired (almost every single audience member leapt up at the start of the show and didn't sit back down). But ensuring each album gets a nod is smart. It captures so many different fans, handing each of them their breathless moment. ""I wanted everyone to feel like we made the show for you,"" she tells the crowd. ""Whether you're new here or you've been hanging out with me for 15 years."" The acoustic set — where she plays her two ""surprise"" songs each night — is not just a highlight because it's the only part of the show we can't predict. First, she plays hit song Red on guitar, beautifully and simply. She then strides over to the piano (now moss-free) and, after quite a confusing will she/won't she play a track from her imminent new album (she instead shows us an alternate cover?), Taylor breaks into a stunning rendition of You're Losing Me, the ballad initially released as a bonus track on the extended version of Midnights. It's the first time she's played the song live, she tells us, and a woman behind me actually sobs, her hand over her mouth. Marking each era also serves as a handy reminder to everyone, particularly the haters, of how successful her career has already been. The energy doesn't stop for the entire show, right up until the moment that Taylor does a deep bow, mouths ""I love you"" and disappears, the crowd beside themselves with adulation. Taylor Swift may sing that she is sick of running as fast as she can in her song The Man, but this epic show demonstrates that she and her juggernaut of success won't be slowing down any time soon.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-17/taylor-swift-eras-tour-kicks-off-in-melbourne/103477038
ts52,"For decades, much of Australia's naval shipbuilding efforts and promises have centred on the Osborne yard in Adelaide's north-west. From diesel to nuclear powered submarines, frigates, air warfare destroyers and offshore patrol vessels, various programs have been announced, commenced, hit by both time and cost blow outs, or axed all together. Shipbuilding in South Australia has been a political hot potato through successive governments, with the current Albanese government set to release revised plans for shipbuilding within days. The state's defence sector, particularly shipbuilding, has been repeatedly spruiked as an economic boon and a pathway to long term prosperity, particularly in the wake of the demise of the automotive industry. But will what was promised actually be delivered? Or is another change in course being plotted, especially for the frigate program based at Osborne? To understand the current state of play in shipbuilding, rewind to 2016. A third Defence White Paper in seven years was released by the Commonwealth, which doubled down on the call to build a fleet of 12 conventionally powered submarines and nine future frigates. It spoke of the need for a continuous shipbuilding program which would not only provide a pipeline of vessels for the Navy but work, and jobs, for decades. ""The continuous onshore build strategy for naval surface vessels my government is delivering will fundamentally transform our naval shipbuilding industry, ensuring its sustainability in the long term,"" then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said in February 2016. Decisions were made against the backdrop of a febrile political and economic climate in South Australia, ahead of the double dissolution federal election that July. It turned out to be the peak of Senator Nick Xenophon's power and influence in Canberra, with the maverick SA independent branching out to attack lower house seats as well as the Senate. Maintaining and expanding the state's submarine and shipbuilding sector was a heavy focus area for the campaign. At the time, there was concern in Liberal ranks that then Industry, Science and Innovation Minister Christopher Pyne could have been challenged in his traditionally safe electorate of Sturt. Pre-dating that was internal angst in the Liberal party room over ousted prime minister Tony Abbott's push to have the submarines built in Japan after the Coalition promised to construct them in Adelaide in 2013. Another layer was the state of South Australia's economy broadly, and the manufacturing sector specifically, little more than a year out from the closure of the Holden plant at Elizabeth. South Australia's unemployment rate hit 7.7 per cent in February 2016, nearly two per cent above the national average. This was before the Whyalla steelworks slid into administration, raising the prospect of one of the state's largest regional centres being plunged into an economic and social abyss. Then there was what was happening with the workforce at Osborne itself, as the Air Warfare Destroyer build started to wind down, leading to job losses. No shipbuilding contracts had been inked, creating a so-called ""valley of death"" for the workforce before any new projects kicked off. Plus, there was a Labor state government agitating and campaigning, headed by Jay Weatherill and assisted by ex-Liberal state opposition leader turned government cabinet minister, Martin Hamilton-Smith. These were among the factors that contributed to the decisions in April 2016 when Naval Group was awarded the $50 billion submarine contract, plus the commitment to build nine frigates in Adelaide and a plan to start offshore patrol vessels project in ASC's yard to fill the ""valley of death"". Two years later British firm BAE Systems was selected as the successful tenderer to build the frigates at Osborne. Fast forward to 2024 and much has changed, particularly since the AUKUS agreement was struck. The nuclear submarine deal between Australia, the United Kingdom and United States in 2021 scuttled the French program for conventionally powered boats which were to be built in Adelaide. AUKUS also helped spark a re-think about the frigate program. Following the release of the Defence Strategic Review last April, the federal government launched another review of Navy's surface ship fleet to make sure its ""size, structure and composition"" complemented nuclear-powered submarines. ""The surface fleet, as it's currently constructed, was determined at a time when Australia was still pursuing a diesel electric powered submarine,"" Defence Minister Richard Marles said at the time. The Hunter class project has hardly been in calm waters since it commenced. Its expected budget jumped from $35 billion to $45 billion, the ship's displacement increased and there have even been calls to scrap the program all together. The national audit office was called in and found the program was ""experiencing an 18-month delay and additional costs due in large part to design immaturity"".  And a report released late last year found the program did not meet the Commonwealth's rules regarding achieving value for money.  All of which has cast doubt about whether the 2016 pledge of nine frigates will be delivered, or if that many vessels is still needed. Economically, South Australia is also in a different place to 2016. It's ridden through the end of car manufacturing and the COVID-19 pandemic and currently has an unemployment rate of four per cent, the second lowest of any state or territory. But it's future plans which have raised some concerns within state government ranks. ABC News has reported at least six frigates, possibly more, will be re-committed to under the revised plans. But other options are also understood to have been considered by the Commonwealth. If the program was cut back to three frigates without an explanation of what would come next, South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas says that would be ""insufficient"" to have continuous ship building at Osborne – raising the spectre of another 'Valley of Death' for the local workforce. ""So in our view, and we've been very clear, that there is no option for the Commonwealth to do anything less than six frigates if they're serious about a continuous ship build,"" he said on Thursday. ""Because six frigates takes us to 2038, 2039 and then allows to announce what follows."" While visiting a factory adjoining the Osborne yard on Friday, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said it sounded to him like Mr Malinauskas ""had an inside run"" on what was coming. ""If Premier Malinauskas is making excuses for Anthony Albanese to reduce the build from nine down to six, then he would have to explain why that is in the best interests of South Australia when clearly it's not,"" he said. South Australians won't have to wait long for clarity.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/short-history-of-major-naval-shipbuilding-programs-in-australia/103477194
ts53,"Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have had an online overhaul, relaunching a new website. They used to be known as Sussex Royal, but their new website drops the word ""royal"".  This is the couple's latest rebranding since their departure from royal duties in 2020. Here's what we know. It's not clear exactly when the website was launched.  The website didn't appear to come with an announcement introducing the site.  However, UK media outlets began reporting about it on Tuesday (local time).  The BBC called it a ""brand revamp"", noting the site's lack of royal references in an article by BBC royal correspondent Sean Coughlan. ""There is an ex-presidential vibe about the new site,"" Coughlan said. Before now, the website for the couple's not-for-profit venture Archewell Foundation was viewed as their official website.  But when internet users enter ""Archewell.com"" into their browser's URL bar, they're redirected to the couple's new site, sussex.com.  The site's home page greets users with a photo of the couple, branded as ""the office of Harry and Meghan"", with the pair's names in the largest font.  The pair also refer to themselves by their royal titles — Duke and Duchess of Sussex — in smaller font.  It also features a regal-looking coat of arms logo which features a lion, a bird, a crown and a shield. When they stepped down as working royals, Prince Harry and Meghan were stripped of the HRH — His or Her Royal Highness — aspect of their titles.  They also gave up their royal patronages and honorary military titles.  But they were still considered the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.  The website features a biography for both Harry and Meghan. They mention their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lillibet, but no other royal family members. The prince's profile details his 10-year military career, his charities and his memoir Spare, but nothing about being fifth in line to the throne. Meanwhile, Meghan's profile focuses strongly on her work supporting women, her career in the entertainment industry, her role in the TV series Suits and her work as an author. The website provides a one-stop shop for the couple's multifaceted pursuits. It also has a ""news"" section, with entries dating back to June 2020.  This is the fourth brand identity used by Harry and Meghan since their marriage in 2018.  Back then, they were represented by Kensington Palace and the KensingtonRoyal social media accounts. They shared this Instagram account with Harry's brother Prince William and his wife Catherine — with the account originally representing Harry, William and Catherine.  The earliest available post from that account dates back to 2015. In 2019, the couple formed their own social media presence and website, branding themselves as Sussex Royal — with the ""Sussex"" part coming from their Duke and Duchess titles.  The previous account wasn't deleted but was instead rebranded as Prince William and Catherine's official account.  However, the Sussex Royal Instagram account was not active for long, as Harry and Meghan stepped down as working royals in 2020. Their old @sussexroyal Instagram account is still visible but hasn't posted anything since March 31, 2020: The Sussex Royal website — sussexroyal.com — is still online but has a message redirecting users to the couple's new website. Here's what that message says: ""This site was established in 2020 and sets out the work streams of Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex prior to their move to the United States."" Then, later in 2020, the couple launched the Archewell website for their not-for-profit organisation.  Without an official Instagram account for the couple, this was treated as their official website.  While they've launched a new website, Harry and Meghan do not appear to have an active official Instagram account.  Through the news section of the couple's new website, Meghan announced she'd be hosting a new podcast with Lemonada Media. The company will also distribute the first season of the couple's Archetypes podcast — which they made during their partnership with Spotify, which ended last year.  Meghan's podcast hasn't got a name yet, but here's what the Duchess did say in her statement: ""Being able to support a female-founded company with a roster of thought-provoking and highly entertaining podcasts is a fantastic way to kick off 2024. ""Our plan to re-release Archetypes so that more people can now have access to it, as well as launching a dynamic new podcast, are well in the works.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-14/prince-harry-and-meghan-website-rebrand/103464678
ts54,"Just when it feels like every item on the family budget is going up, health insurance providers are making a plea to the government to hike their premiums. In December, their bid to add up to 6 per cent to the cost of their policies was knocked back, but they are expected to have another go at getting the health minister's approval for a smaller increase. So are you better off having private health insurance or relying entirely on the public system?  Hannah Israel, 27, from Tasmania is not so sure. Two years ago, she took out full hospital and extras cover because she wanted the freedom to access care without going on a waitlist in the public system. Then she bought a house and decided to ditch her extras cover. Instead of paying $40 each month for services she felt she didn't need, she put that money into her home loan. ""It's a nice little chunk off my mortgage,"" she said. Now she's considering whether to drop her hospital cover as well. That decision is a bit trickier because she knows she will get stung with additional tax if she doesn't have it. But if premiums go up, will she be better off paying the tax? Working that out is complicated so we've asked a few experts for their advice on what to consider.  Hang on. Don't we get free healthcare in Australia? Yes, Australia boasts universal healthcare so citizens and permanent residents get free or low-cost health and hospital services. Our public health system is generally good, but if you can afford it you may want to use private clinics and hospitals so you can choose which doctor treats you, get your own room and have procedures without going on a lengthy waiting list. Private health insurance helps pay some of those costs and extras cover helps with services not covered in the public system like optical, dental and physiotherapy. Health economist Professor Yuting Zhang at Melbourne University says the government encourages people to get private health insurance to take pressure off the public system. The view is this will drive equity by improving access to the public system for people who can't afford private healthcare, but she questions whether this is truly the case. Professor Zhang's research at Melbourne University has found that more people buying private health insurance makes little difference to the length of time patients spend on public health waiting lists. ""We have to figure out why do we have private health insurance sitting alongside Medicare,"" she says. That's a much larger issue, so for now let's focus on how current government policy affects you. Are you saying the government will help me pay for health insurance? Well, yes and no. If you have private health cover, you may be eligible to get a discount on your insurance premium paid for by the government. The amount depends on your age and income. If you're single and earn $144,000 or less, you can get anywhere between an 8.2 and 32.8 per cent discount. For couples and families, it's $288,000 or less. But if you haven't been insured before, the government can sting you with a Lifetime Health Cover loading. If you decide to get hospital cover later in life, you'll be slugged with a 2 per cent penalty on your basic premium for every year over the age of 30. The maximum loading is 70 per cent and it's removed only after ten continuous years of holding private health insurance. But that's not all. Because the government really, really wants you to have private health insurance, it charges higher-income earners a Medicare levy surcharge for not having cover. This applies to singles earning more than $93,000 and families earning over $186,000. Those without private hospital cover — with an excess of $750 or less for singles and $1,500 or less for families — will pay an extra tax on their income of between 1 and 1.5 per cent, depending on how much they earn.  If you're going to have to pay the Medicare levy surcharge, it could be worth getting private health insurance instead. Professor Yuting Zhang says that people with higher earnings might save money by avoiding the extra tax. ""They're probably better off in terms of buying the cheapest plan, even though [they] don't use it,"" she said. Do you have a story to share? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au Ms Israel is not convinced her health insurance offers value for money but says it could be a different story if she needed hospital treatment. ""And certainly that'll change when I look at having kids and as I get older,"" she said. Financial adviser Adele Martin says everyone's situation is different so it's important to consider personal circumstances when weighing up the value of having cover. ""You don't want to send yourself broke and get yourself into credit card debt [just] to keep the private health,"" she says. She recommends factoring into your decision your medical history, healthcare needs and future events like having a baby. Not exactly.  Once you get private health insurance, you still need to fork out cash on top of your premium for treatment, medication and other associated costs. That's because your health insurance may only cover part of the cost of the medical service or product you need. And you may have to pay an excess – an amount your health insurance provider charges when you are admitted to hospital. You can change the excess amount to adjust how much your premium is.  According to data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, individuals paid 15 per cent of the country's total healthcare expenditure in 2019-2020, almost twice what health insurers chipped in. Health economist Professor Brenda Gannon says people may take out health insurance as a way to save money, but then face large expenses when they need to use it. ""People may still be even more out-of-pocket,"" she says. The government's new medical costs finder lets you see what people with private health insurance pay out-of-pocket for different procedures.  The Department of Health also encourages people to get an estimate of out-of-pocket costs from their insurer and healthcare provider prior to starting treatment. If you need a particular procedure, you should also check the waiting periods for claiming benefits when you first get insurance. Jeni Hall, a single mother with a two-year-old and a mortgage, says she's feeling the pinch right now but doesn't know if ditching her health insurance is the right thing to do. Some large medical costs a few years ago prompted her to take out a high level of cover. Now she says her policy costs so much each month she can't afford to see a GP for anything but urgent issues. ""Behind the mortgage and daycare, it's the single most expensive bill of the month,"" she said. She works full-time and considers herself to be on a good salary but says she sometimes can't pay all her bills. ""My mum and dad have stepped in quite a bit. Just to help get me over the line until payday,"" she said. More than one in two Australians have some form of private health insurance. Professor Gannon says people tend to think in the moment and might be less inclined to buy health insurance as the cost of living goes up. ""They might think in the next year, I don't need this, I can't afford it,"" she says. She warns that the lifetime penalty and the Medicare levy surcharge can make health insurance more costly over the long term. Ms Martin says it's important to budget wisely. She recommends reviewing your policy regularly and comparing providers to ensure you're getting the best value. ""If this is going to save you a 1,000 bucks or 500 bucks a year and take you 30 minutes, maybe it's worth it,"" she says. ASIC's MoneySmart website offers tools, tips and calculators to help manage money and make more informed financial decisions.  On private health insurance, MoneySmart's Andrew Dadswell suggests paying attention to the fine print.  To choose the right policy for you, find out how basic ambulance cover, hospital cover or extras cover differ Compare policy product disclosure statements to understand what is included and what is not Before signing up, think about who the cover is for and how much you can afford Work out what medical products or services you use to decide which extras you need and remember to check if there is a waiting period before you can claim any services If you are unhappy with your health insurance discuss with your provider how you would like the problem fixed and if the problem isn’t resolved write them a formal complaint Disclaimer: This is general advice only. Please see a professional for advice on your individual financial circumstances. As a financial adviser, Adele Martin does not receive payment from health insurance providers.

ts55,"It's 2020 and most of the world is under pandemic restrictions of some kind. For music lovers, our usual social outlets — seeing live music, or playing music and singing with others — are off the table. Singing together is even deemed dangerous in the environment of COVID-19. At ABC Classic, we live by our motto ""Life's better with music"". We spent the pandemic finding every way we could to share that in a world where music became more important than ever, but it was something we could no longer make together in real life. Knowing all the benefits of singing, and as a socially distant Christmas looked likely, we hatched a plan to start an online choir and bring people together to sing across the country. From kitchens, dining tables, and kids' bedrooms, we figured out how to make it happen technically. However, the question remained: What music could bring Australia together? It clearly wouldn't be the popular carols reflective of European and North American experiences of Christmas, full of snow, firesides, and sleigh bells. The only option was to commission a brand new carol, composed with the Australian experience of Christmas in mind, and reflective of our common experience at that time. Deborah Cheetham Fraillon AM, Yorta Yorta and Yuin composer, soprano and Christmas lover, joined the project and she composed the first-ever Classic Choir song, Christmas With You. Cheetham Fraillon dedicated the song to ""everyone who has been parted from those they love in this year of loss and chaos"". She explained how we've all been in a situation where we can't be with our loved ones at Christmas. ""I wanted to capture that longing, but also the hope that can spring from knowing that there are those who are thinking of you, even if you can't physically be together."" That first year, more than 1,500 people sent in videos of them singing Christmas With You. ARIA-winning producer and engineer Virginia Read led an audio team to blend everyone's voices into a single choir, and digital producer Matthew Lorenzon worked magic to represent everyone on screen. Everyone at ABC Classic played a part in making the Classic Choir sing, but especially our audience. I must have listened to Christmas With You hundreds of times before we shared that final video, but I still burst into tears when we premiered it on social media. I know I wasn't the only one. Cheetham Fraillon says it's one of the most rewarding pieces she's written. ""Watching people's response, and what it meant to them, I'm getting emotional just thinking about it,"" she shared. She recognised the effort singers went to learning the piece and personalising it. ""You could see they were singing it about someone they loved and their own circumstance,"" she said. ""I don't think there's anything more a composer can ask than to be understood and to actually know that you've reached someone on that deep emotional level."" Since then, the growing Classic Choir Songbook focuses on the Australian experience of Christmas and summer. Community is at the heart of it. Content manager Kat McGuffie stressed the important role of ABC Classic in fostering music-making across the nation and getting people singing. ""Growing up in Darwin, I saw firsthand how vital community music-making was to bringing people together and finding identity,"" she said. She sees the Classic Choir Songbook as something that connects music lovers through stories that reflect Australian life: ""No sleighbells and snowflakes! Schools, community groups, professional choirs and families now own a collection of songs made just for them."" In 2021, after a second year of social distancing, songstress Katie Noonan wrote All Is Love for the choir. It was all about family and home: ""Whatever family is to you. Your chosen family, your birth family, or your rainbow family. All is love,"" Noonan said at the time. Noonan's lyrics reflected the many places people find home, apparent in the videos the choir submitted. People sang from dining tables, living rooms, a church, nature, and even their shed. Among them were a Manchu family in Melbourne who picked up the call to sing on the ABC's WeChat account. The lyrics resonated with the Liu family: ""Music is the bond of our family … We have so many pressures in life, but family gives us peace of mind, gives us the sense of happiness."" Then in 2022, as the world started to open up, Classic Choir moved toward celebrating the joy of singing together. Gardening Australia presenter and Bundjalung man Clarence Slockee shared a new take on the classic carol, Oh Christmas Tree. Slockee consulted elders and communities from Noongar country in Western Australia to Lutruwita (Tasmania) for permission to use words from the various language groups in the song. He set out to explore the diverse seasons and foods that make Australian Christmas so unique. For Slockee, the song was ""a celebration of family and of life. It's a time of everybody coming together and not thinking about themselves for once – thinking about others and the bigger picture."" For the first time, we received many submissions from choirs and groups of people singing together in person. It was clear that the Classic Choir was evolving. Three years, and three songs later, this year's Classic Choir song is Summer Together, a new tune with music by Elena Kats-Chernin and words by Gunai poet Kirli Saunders. Kats-Chernin, who was born in Uzbekistan, had no idea what Christmas carols were when she came to Australia in 1975. But she was soon singing carols at the Sydney Opera House after joining her school choir. ""It was such a fantastic feeling,"" she recalled. ""I didn't know anyone and didn't speak English that well but being in a choir helped me learn faster."" Summer Together captures the quintessential Australian summer: sharing a feed, being outdoors and spending time with loved ones. Vanessa Hughes, ABC Classic's Drive presenter and self-confessed choir nerd, has been hard at work getting people singing. ""It's changed so much since we started singing together in 2020,"" she reflected. ""Then it was about making anything meaningful to improve our wellbeing at such a tricky time, but now Classic Choir is about so much more, singing with other people in the room. Actually hearing each other, listening to each other Every Thursday, she dedicates the Classic Choir Hour to choirs, choral music and the joy of singing. She's been connecting people with their local groups and giving people who can't get to rehearsals a chance to sing along with the radio. Liz, a listener from Mount Gambier, is going to sing Summer Together with her friend Jude at the family Christmas lunch. She thinks the choir is a great place to start singing ""because you can be doing it in the privacy of your own kitchen, or your own sunroom, or your own garden … there is nobody then to be critical."" In the spirit of getting people together, we held our first in-person rehearsals at the ABC in Brisbane, Sydney and Adelaide. Conductor Christie Anderson, who led the Adelaide rehearsal, emphasised the importance of singing together. ""We learn a lot about ourselves. We learn a lot about accepting one another. I think it's a really positive environment for inclusivity,"" she said. Choirs around Australia are singing music from the Classic Choir Songbook in their end-of-year concerts. One of those choirs is Willoughby Symphony Choir. Hailing from Northern England, music director Peter Ellis says that even after 22 years in Australia, he's still getting used to a hot Christmas, but it's nice to have music for a specific Australian audience. He appreciates singing songs about ""all the wonderful things about an Australian Christmas, [like] the food"". This year we're inviting anyone singing music from the Classic Choir Songbook to be part of our gallery and to share a video of your rehearsal or performance, whether it's just you, your family or loved ones, community choir or professional singers. Young adult choir VOX star in this year's music video, performing Summer Together against the picturesque backdrop of Gadigal country's Sydney Harbour. On Sunday from 2pm, sing along with VOX and Sydney Philharmonia Choirs and Orchestra in our live broadcast of Carols At The House, featuring Summer Together, as well as a mix of carols and favourite Christmas music. So, raise your voice and be a part of the Classic Choir. In the words of Gwladys, who sings with Rewire Musical Memories Choir: ""When you sing, it just makes you feel good.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/backstory/2023-12-16/australians-singing-their-way-to-a-shared-christmas/103227616
ts56,"Australians appear to have avoided a political showdown this week, with the Coalition poised to wave through the government's proposed overhaul of the stage 3 tax cuts. Both parties have claimed that their tax package does a better of job tackling Australia's cost of living crisis. The Coalition insists its tax reforms should be appreciated as an entire package, with stages 1 and 2 targeted to low and middle-income earners, and stage 3 designed to ""encourage aspiration"". ""If you take away the final part, you'll unbalance the whole package,"" former federal treasurer Peter Costello has warned. Meanwhile, Labor argues its changes are better aimed at low and middle-income households ""disproportionately impacted"" by the crisis. ""These new tax cuts are designed to provide bigger tax cuts for middle Australia,"" according to the prime minister's press release announcing the revised plan. Now, new figures shared exclusively with the ABC reveal the taxable income you need to earn to receive the biggest percentage return across all three stages if the proposed changes are passed into law. At $135,000 a year, this magic number doesn't exactly represent ""middle Australia"". ""It's certainly more equitable than the alternative,"" says economist Ben Phillips, from ANU's Centre for Social Research and Methods, which supplied the figures. ""Under the Coalition, really, the higher you went up the income scale, the higher the percentage savings … It's a package very much tilted in favour of high-income earners. ""It's true that Labor's plan still probably tilts things towards more high-income individuals. But it still means that about 90 per cent of people who pay tax will be better off [than under the original plan]."" He points out that the nature of the tax system makes it difficult to return the same percentage to everyone. ""If you're on $20,000, for example, you're not paying any tax … so it's hard to give part of that back. That's just the nature of the tax system."" See whether your tax cut is bigger under the original or revised plan, across all three stages. The ANU data shows that under the revised plan, the largest percentage return will go to those on a taxable income of $135,000 a year. Those individuals will receive a tax cut of 4.7 per cent of their income, or $6,294, once the tax cuts from all three stages are included. Under the Coalition's original plan, the largest percentage return goes to the highest earners, with those on $200,000 set to receive a tax cut of 5.8 per cent of their income, or $11,640. Under both plans, the smallest percentage return after the full package of cuts is taken into account will go to those on a taxable income of $21,000. On both plans, they receive a return of 0.4 per cent of their income, or $87 – and all of that was already received during stages 1 and 2. ""Clearly, if you had the most progressive tax cuts, you would be giving a higher percentage back to those in the lowest tax brackets. That's clearly not happening [in either plan],"" economist Nicki Hutley says. ""It's very easy to say [Labor] should have done more for people on median incomes of $60,000 rather than $135,000. But they weren't starting with a blank slate … and when you take somebody else's creation, you’re always going to end up with a Frankenstein’s monster. ""It's not perfect, that's for sure. Is it awful? No."" And while neither plan returns the biggest tax cut to those on median incomes, it's hardly surprising that both parties have focused their public campaigns squarely on ""middle Australia"". ""There’s a lot of votes in “middle Australia"" … [because] a lot of people consider themselves middle income, even if they’re on $150,000,"" Associate Professor Phillips says. According to Ms Hutley, it's well established that people are ""absolutely terrible"" at identifying whether they're rich, poor or truly in the middle. ""So, appealing to that group, it's just clever politics."" The calculations used in this story assume you are not in receipt of government pensions and allowances, and do not adjust for bracket creep.

ts57,"An act of class warfare or a bid to ensure ""no one is left behind""? The Labor government's dramatic redesign of the Stage 3 tax cuts has been accused of ""pitting one Australian against the other"" – and it's clear that there will be winners and losers. Under the proposed changes, everyone with a taxable income below $146,486 will receive a larger tax cut than under the original plan, while top income earners will walk away with much less than promised. But which neighbourhoods, occupations and age groups are more likely to win or lose from the revised plan? We've delved into the data to find out how different parts of Australia compare. Australia's youngest workers are the most likely to benefit from the proposed changes, with Generation Z recording the largest share of workers set to receive bigger returns under the new plan. In the 2021 financial year, about 99 per cent of Gen Z's 1.9 million workers had taxable incomes below $150,000, according to Australian Tax Office figures. (In this data, Gen Z includes those aged 24 and under at the time.) While $150,000 is slightly above the $146,486 threshold for determining who will benefit under the new plan compared to the original, this is the closest we can get using these statistics. (And economists have assured us it's close, given the difference is minimal for those nearest the threshold figure.)  ""This is definitely better for younger workers who are more likely to be in junior positions earning lower incomes. They're more likely to be working part-time, maybe mixing study and work,"" says director of Impact Economics Angela Jackson. This is in contrast to Gen X, which has the smallest share of workers set to gain from the changes – although it's still a sizeable chunk. Roughly 88 per cent of Gen X's 4.2 million workers will receive a bigger tax cut under the new plan than the original. In our data, workers in this generation were aged 40-54 in 2021. Grattan Institute economic policy program director Brendan Coates says that's because Gen Xers are approaching the top of their earning capacity. ""Earnings among Australian workers tend to peak between the ages of 45 and 50. That's when people have the most experience, when they're in management roles that pay more,"" he says. ""Gen Xers are entering that peak earning phase now so are probably among those who are going to be hit hardest."" More than nine in 10 workers in every other generation stand to benefit from the proposed changes. This includes 92 per cent of Australia's 3.4 million working Baby Boomers (aged 55-74 in 2020-21, the year of the data), 95 per cent of the nation's 5 million working Millennials (aged 25-39 in 2020-21) and 96 per cent of about 560,000 Silent generation workers (aged 75 and older in 2020-21). More than 99 per cent of workers have occupations in which most people will gain more from the redesign than the original plan. This chart shows every job worked by one of the 15.1 million Australian residents who submitted a tax return in 2020-21. It includes 439 jobs, ranging from anaesthetist (the highest earners, on a median taxable income of $387,736 a year) and solicitor ($111,387) to truck driver ($66,165) and general sales assistant ($34,353). The median income is the number at which half of workers earn more and half earn less. This means that more than half of workers in any job with a median taxable income below $146,486 earn above this amount, so stand to benefit from the proposed changes. In 2020-21, 99.8 per cent of women and 99.3 per cent of men worked in such jobs. ""The original stage 3 tax cuts were essentially very good for very rich men and not so good for everyone else,"" says Australia Institute chief economist Greg Jericho. ""It really is just surgeons, judges and politicians who benefit, basically … Almost everyone else will be able to look around at the people doing their jobs and know that most will be getting a bigger tax cut under these changes."" Of the 427 jobs that employed women, only nine had a median taxable income above the threshold. The list of nine includes surgeons, psychiatrists and legislators (which includes members of parliament). For men, 21 out of 435 jobs – including dental practitioner, mining engineer and financial investment advisor – delivered a taxable income above $146,486. Women are clearly the big winners from the changes, according to Dr Jackson. ""The redesign is really targeting [low and middle income] workers. Women tend to be more likely to work part-time and in occupations with lower average earnings, which is why they're the bigger winners."" This is good news not only from a gender perspective, but for the wider economy, Coates adds. ""We'd expect a bigger economic bang for buck because [the changes] target lower-income workers who … have more capacity to pick up an extra day of work than those working full-time,"" he says. ""A lot of those classic pink-collar occupations – registered nurse, childcare worker, disabled carer, school teacher – they are among the biggest beneficiaries."" Across Australia's 2,600 postcodes, those who stand to benefit from the redesign outnumber those who miss out, without exception. The map below shows how much those who will gain outnumber those who will lose. For example, in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy (postcode 3065), nearly five times as many workers will benefit as will miss out.  In Puckapunyal, north of Melbourne, there were no reported incomes above $180,000, so we know most people there will benefit from the changes. Even in neighbourhoods boasting the highest share of top income earners – Peppermint Grove and Cottesloe in Perth (postcode 6011), and Northbridge in Sydney (postcode 2063) – those who benefit from the redesign outnumber those who miss out by a ratio of 1.3. ""Well over 10 million Australians are going to benefit, whereas less than 2 million Australians will be slightly worse off,"" says Australia Institute senior economist Matt Grudnoff. ""So if we look at geographic areas, it would be very unusual to find such a concentration of high income earners that a majority in that area would actually be worse off."" Tax office statistics don't allow us to hone in on the $146,486 divide at the postcode level. However, they do tell us the number of people in each postcode who will benefit most from the proposed changes (that's those on taxable incomes between $45,001 and $120,000) and the numbers who will miss out compared to the original plan (those on taxable incomes above $180,000). In two-thirds of postcodes with at least 100 workers in 2020-21, more than 10 times as many stood to benefit than to lose from the redesign. ""Everyone earning in the $45,000 to $120,000 range will see their tax cut increase by about $800 per year,"" Grudnoff says. ""The biggest losers are those earning more than $180,000. And to be clear, they're getting a smaller cut than they otherwise would but they'll still walk away with a $4,000 tax cut."" According to the data, the majority of postcodes where winners outnumber losers most starkly are in regional and rural Australia. Jericho says this presents an ""interesting dilemma"" for the Nationals Party, which as the junior partner in the Coalition, opposes the proposal. ""We can pretty safely say that every Nationals electorate will be better off … because they benefit more low- and middle-income earners, and rural electorates have more [of these] earners,"" Jericho says. ""These are the types of changes to the tax cuts that the National party should be cheering for."" He says the tax office data exposes the absurdity of criticisms from Nationals Party leader David Littleproud that the revised cuts amount to ""class warfare"". ""What this really highlights is … that the original [plan] was incredibly skewed to favour the wealthy.""

ts58,"From the bull ant sting to the 'physical torture' of the irukandji, we asked venom expert Bryan Fry to rank Australia's most painful creatures It might be fitting that Bryan Fry's first memory is of ""extraordinary, body-wide, kill-me-now"" pain. The University of Queensland professor's childhood battle with spinal meningitis forced him to learn to walk again but also left him with a fascination with all things pain-inducing. ""[It was] that early experience combined with my mum being the daughter of UN workers … living in Africa,"" the US-born, Australia-based venomologist says. ""I remember looking at her photo albums of cobras in the garden, a viper in their tennis court. They even had a black mamba come into their house one time."" He now studies different types of venom, their evolutions, their effects and even their potential uses. Australia has earned its reputation for having the most dangerous animals – National Geographic even compiled a top-30 list. The reputation has sparked some to turn to science to find out more.  Pain and fear may also be driving our interest. ""We do have a fascination with the macabre,"" says Professor Fry. ""There's a million deadly whatever type of animal programs out there, of varying quality … and YouTube spawns even more. ""People get interested in these animals [because of] the fact that they can mess you up."" So without further ado, here's Professor Fry's top 10 most painful stings. People with arachnophobia should proceed with caution. There are about 90 different species of bull ants in Australia – nine at least recorded in Sydney, according to the Australian Museum. Their nests are underground and they'll attack anything of any size that gets too close. The Australian Jack Jumper ant, a bigger kind, is more likely to cause a severe allergic reaction. This is where problems can arise, according to Professor Fry. ""If you look at Tasmania … it seems there's something with that species of bull ant,"" he says. ""It's not necessarily that there's more sting but that it seems to be a particularly allergenic one."" These bugs live mainly in fresh water in eastern Australia and the Indo-Pacific, and can grow up to seven centimetres long. ""The sting is described as taking a six-inch nail, heating it up and driving it through the sole of your foot,"" says Professor Fry. ""These things are big, and they'll even feed on small turtles. They're a predator's predator."" It's worth noting that these bugs are also called Giant Fishkillers. ""It doesn't have mouth parts so essentially it stabs you with this big drinking straw, injects you with a bunch of digestive enzymes, and then sucks it up,"" says Professor Fry. ""It kills its prey by digesting them to death, and it really, really hurts to be digested to death."" Caterpillars were Professor Fry's first envenomation, and the memory is lasting. ""I was the dumb monkey who picked up the slow moving animal that was brightly coloured and out during the daytime,"" he says. ""The really brightly coloured caterpillars of any kind are going to be the ones that are going to hurt you in some way. ""If they've got spikes, you have a pretty good idea they're venomous. If they're smooth you have a good idea they're poisonous. ""The poisonous ones are basically suicide bombers … they induce profound nausea [and] gastric pain. A bird that ate this is not going to forget it."" This anemone is ""exactly as much fun as it sounds"", according to Professor Fry. Its tentacles split into branches again and again, making it look a little like broccoli. Their powerful stings can cause skin ulcers on humans. ""A mate of mine [was stung] on a collecting trip and he couldn't get out of bed for three days because he was … in absolute agony. ""It's easy to see why the person who discovered it got absolutely drilled by it because it's a very pretty animal. ""It's … chemical krav maga."" Up to 21 arms, ""hundreds"" of thorns and a taste for coral – that's how the Australia Institute of Marine Science describes these starfish, which they say can occur in ""plague proportions"".  Adults can grow up to 80 centimetres wide. ""When we were researching them, the spines were so sharp they just went through my gloves,"" Professor Fry says. ""It just hurt."" The starfish is ""commonly encountered by divers"", but he says it's ""not their fault"". ""They're treated like this invasive species but they're native to the Barrier Reef … it's not their fault we created the perfect environment for them. ""We removed their major predators [which are] the big snails … and we weakened the defences of their major prey, the corals."" The Australian Museum says more than 250 people stung by these spiders need antivenom every year, ""with several milder envenomations probably going unreported"". ""Intense local pain is the key thing here,"" Professor Fry says. ""It's basically like putting your [genitals] onto a welding torch."" There have been no deaths reported since the 1950s, when the antivenom was introduced to Australia. ""My personal top-three most painful experiences in my life, number three is a scorpion in the amazon, number two is a stingray in Moreton Bay,"" Professor Fry says. ""The only thing that exceeded that stingray for me was breaking my back in three places."" Stingrays aren't aggressive, according to South Australia's Environment Department – which labels them ""curious and playful animals"" – but they do have a barb on the end of their tail. It's this venomous barb, covered in flat spines made of a kind of cartilage, which Professor Fry says does the most damage. ""Unlike the stone fish, the stingray has … mechanical damage,"" he says. ""It's not the going in that's the problem but those barbs when they yank it back leave this jagged tear."" Fatal stings are very rare, with the most notable being the death of Australian conservationist Steve Irwin in 2006. Masters of camouflage, stonefish have a series of spines along their back that can inject venom when stepped on. There are two types in Australia: the reef stonefish and the estuary stonefish, which is also called the ""horrid stonefish"" or synanceia horrida. ""They're less potentially lethal doses than a box jellyfish, but like a box jellyfish they can kill you from the pain alone,"" says Professor Fry. ""People have done things like cut their fingers off to get the pain to stop. ""People lose their minds over the pain … with the stonefish, like all fish, the venom is very sensitive to heat, so it breaks down really easily. ""All you have to do is put the affected limb in water that's around 50 degrees and you're fine, that's enough to denature the venom and stop the pain."" The box jellyfish is named for its box-shaped ""bell"" or head, and it's mostly found in tropical waters along the top of Western Australia, the NT and through to Queensland. ""It takes two metres of tentacle combined contact to kill you, but they've got four nodes of tentacles,"" Professor Fry says. ""Each node has 15 tentacles and each tentacle can be 3-4 metres long. So if you do the maths a big box jelly can potentially have 120 lethal doses brushing against your leg."" The NT's ""stinger season"" officially started on October 1 last year, and is expected to continue until May 2024. There are two ways to die from stings, says Professor Fry. ""The first is within the first two-to-five minutes with the pain, that's going to be shock,"" he says. ""That's all about managing blood pressure, [victims] are crashing to lethal hypotension levels. ""If they survive that, they have a chance of 20-30 minutes later dying from cardiovascular collapse from the venom's direct effects on the cardiovascular system. ""You've got this crisis period but within an hour that's passed. ""But the venom has been described as taking an iron poker, heating it up to molten levels, dipping it in acid and then whipping it as hard as you can across the person. ""They get dermonecrotic burns, which are exactly as much fun as they sound."" Extreme anxiety, shooting pains, fluid in the lungs and potential brain haemorrhage — it may be just 1-2 centimetres large but the irukandji jellyfish can have a deadly impact. More than that, however, Professor Fry says it can be the ""mental injuries"" that cause far more damage. ""Your average civilian who gets stung by one of these things is not going to have the lifetime of mental scar tissue that I've accumulated,"" he says. ""I know from experience that lying on a hospital bed wondering if you're going to die from an envenomation is the loneliest place on earth. ""The trauma is far and away the worst in this sense and does cause actual mental injuries."" Each tentacle, up to a metre long, and its head, have stingers, and researchers in Far North Queensland say they ""actively"" hunt for prey despite being more than 90 per cent water. ""The pain goes on for two weeks or more, successively getting worse as time goes on … it is a brutality, a physical torture,"" says Professor Fry. ""I've heard it from [multiple people] who've been stung, almost the exact same words, where they describe an impending feeling of doom. ""There's this psychological effect that is as traumatising to these people as the physical impact of the pain. ""There's no antivenom. We have no way of neutralising it at this point, all we can do is treat the symptoms. ""There's a million different ways to produce pain … and in the case of the Irukandji, whatever pain pathway it's going through … it's not one of the pain pathways that morphine blocks. ""Morphine has no effect on these people. Zero.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-26/stings-venoms-bites-ranked/103319874
ts59,"Dan Ball remembers a time when he was so exhausted from work that he started to question his sense of reality. ""I remember the actual moment of being in a meeting … and almost from outside of my body, [I was] listening to what I was saying,"" Dan recalls. In 2018, it wasn't uncommon for Dan to work up to 14 hours a day in the technology industry. He used to pride himself on being ""the first person in the office"" in the morning, right up until he experienced an ""episode of exhaustion and burnout"". ""It was quite confronting when I had that realisation; it's almost like my body turned around to me before my mind could even catch up and said 'No, this is not sustainable Dan',"" he says. According to a study published in 2023 from the University of Melbourne, one in two workers aged between 18 and 54 have reported feeling exhausted at work. ""[That] is very high,"" says Professor Ian Hickie, who is the co-director of Health and Policy at the University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Centre. ""It does cause us all to stop and go; now hang on a sec. Work is supposed to be the fun part of life, the enjoyable bit, the bit we thrive on. And yet we say we're exhausted by it?"" He describes this as the ""great November disease"" in Australia. ""[It's] the belief that if I can just get to Christmas and fall over the finishing line, then, in December, it will all come good. And by January, it'll all be fixed,"" he explains. But, he says, it's simply not true. Professor Mark Wooden, who is a research fellow at the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne, has also observed a rise in tiredness across Australian workplaces. He's the former director of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics project in Australia, also known as the Hilda survey, which looks at the topic of tiredness, among other things. ""It was fairly stable throughout the 2000s when we first started [the survey], but it has been picking up,"" he tells ABC RN's This Working Life. ""Pretty much this feeling of tiredness got worse for most age groups up to about the age of … about 45."" But people aren't always tired because they've got too much to do, Professor Wooden says. Nearly two decades ago, 18 per cent of people were working more than 50 hours a week. That's now down to 11 per cent. Despite fewer people ""feeling rushed or pressed for time"", Professor Wooden suspects that there are other stresses that people are experiencing. ""For most people, we're all feeling the cost of rising rents, rising mortgage costs, and these sorts of things. So that's imposing stress; therefore, that's affecting sleep quality,"" he says. ""Therefore, that's affecting you in feeling tired, right? You may be going to bed, but you're not sleeping well. That's one speculative response."" Feeling stressed, anxious, or depressed can also contribute to people feeling tired. Professor Hickie explains that when people are stressed — just like when their body is fighting an infection or, in ancient times, when they were being chased by a lion — they release hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol. ""It should turn off again. But if it stays on and continues with its excited, aroused fashion in the brain, that burns up energy,"" he explains. ""In fact, it burns up nerve cell connections, and it actually does toxic damage."" And if it goes on for more than 24 hours, it disrupts your sleep-wake cycle, he adds, because your brain is busy ""reconnecting nerve cells"". Natasha Yates has worked in general practice for more than 20 years in both rural and urban settings. During that time, she's seen many patients come into her practice and request medical certificates because they feel too exhausted to work. ""What I'm hearing from patients is that our [life] expectations are different. And the workplace expectations are different as well,"" Dr Yates says. Not having the energy to take part in the activities you used to enjoy doing Regularly declining invitations to catch up with friends Avoiding exercise altogether ""Almost always, when I dig down, what they are suffering from is emotional or mental fatigue. And their workplaces have become toxic,"" she says. They may be finding that they're just not able to perform at work or that they're not getting the support that they need. ""So in desperation, they're coming to a GP to ask for a medical certificate to enable them to recover,"" she says. But she reiterates that taking time off work is unlikely to fix the real issue. ""If they're in a toxic workplace and they're in a place where they're not given the resources to be able to look after themselves properly, no amount of time off is going to enable them to get back to work fully functioning again,"" she says. Professor Hickie has seen people lose interest in activities they once enjoyed doing, but he says that doesn't necessarily mean you need to entirely change your career. ""I see doctors who've been great doctors their whole life, who no longer care about medicine. But medicine is not the problem. I see nurses [who] are not interested in caring about people. And these people cared about people their whole lives,"" he says. ""I don't think the profession is the problem; I don't think you've lost interest in the thing you are passionately engaged with. I think it might be that you are overwhelmed."" Years ago, an older colleague gave him the advice to change directions within his career at least four times. ""Find new things; do different things. Don't just do the same thing, year in, year out,"" he says. And the onus shouldn't be on the individual to recognise when they're burnt out or suffering from extreme exhaustion, he adds. ""I do think there's a management responsibility. I think healthy workplaces and healthy organisations have a management response. They do not rely on individuals just making random choices; individuals make bad choices … People don't always recognise the situation they're in; they don't recognise how tired they are,"" he says. Today, Dan Ball is working as a Mental Health First Aid Instructor in Melbourne, and he's studying to become a psychologist. In this role, he helps people recognise the signs of burnout. But he's also using some of his former skills from the technology industry to create safer environments in the workplace surrounding mental health. He helped create an app called By Mind Side, which alerts workplaces when their mental first aid supporters might be at risk of burnout.  ""Supporting the supporter is a huge passion of mine. In the workplace, if an organisation is serious about training staff to be a listening ear to their colleagues, it's fundamental they provide a structure to support them,"" he says. Dan's also found solace by being involved in an Australia-wide men's support group called The Men's Table. ""That's definitely something that has helped me immensely,"" he says. ""The slogan is 'we don't just talk about footy and sh**',"" he laughs. Instead, it's also a ""place for men to go and open up"". Finally, he's made other positive changes in his life including cutting back on screen time, putting his phone away for ""micro breaks"", and starting his mornings with meditation or exercise.

ts60,"Anthea Gaffney insists on buying fresh fruit and vegetables for her two kids, but she's started to feel the pinch at the check-out.  The Brisbane sales manager was flabbergasted when she saw the cost of cherry tomatoes increasing from $3.98 per punnet to $6.98 in a matter of months. ""I'm looking at other options now like the corns, the eggplants, the cucumbers, zucchinis — the stuff we wouldn't normally go to,"" Ms Gaffney said. ""It's something I wouldn't have considered previously, but with the cost of living crisis that we're seeing through the media day in, day out, everything's going up."" Shoppers have watched the price of fruit and vegetables skyrocket despite canned produce remaining relatively cheap.  Certain fruits and vegetables are now much cheaper in cans despite typically being grown and processed in several countries before eventually arriving on Australian shelves. Rural Economies Centre of Excellence director Ben Lyons says there are many reasons for this.  The University of Southern Queensland associate professor says Australian farmers are seeing steep increases in expenses. Dr Lyons said costs had increased roughly 30-to-60 per cent in the past five years, largely due to fuel and stronger industrial relations laws. In comparison, Dr Lyons said tinned produce was typically done very cheaply overseas in enormous quantities by large conglomerates. He said canned food had a much longer shelf life, meaning it was easier to produce and store in bulk without worrying about spoilage. Dr Lyons said Australians threw away so much food that it would take an area the size of Victoria to grow it all. A comparison by ABC Radio Brisbane Afternoons host Kat Feeney found fresh tomatoes at Woolworths were more than twice as expensive as tinned tomatoes. However, fresh odd-bunch pears were much cheaper at $3.20 per kilogram compared to tinned own-brand pears at $5.12 per kilogram. Dr Lyons said Australia's big supermarkets had very strong bargaining power, meaning that farmers often had little room to negotiate. He said land usage was a growing concern in Queensland, with more farmers deciding to sell their land and leave. Dr Lyons said this was often due to rising costs not being matched by the wholesale prices offered by supermarkets. ""Let's face it, the big two or three dictate what the price will be,"" he said. ""The pears befuddle me a little bit. I worry for the producer of the fresh pears when I hear that because they're obviously not making much money. ""One of the challenges the industry faces is that it's a bit of a black box. The lack of market transparency is a real challenge and we need to question it.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-30/why-aussie-produce-is-more-expensive-than-canned/103401334
ts61,"Numbats are built to handle the heat. The stripy marsupial, Myrmecobius fasciatus, regulates body temperature through raising or flattening its fur, to save energy managing thermoregulation, since its diet of thousands of termites a day provides very little energy. It has evolved to only operate during daylight hours, the same time its insect prey is active. But this could soon bring challenges in a warming climate. New research from Curtin University, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, suggests as little as 10 minutes in the sun on hot days can result in the small mammal overheating and retreating to a burrow or hollow. And that has scientists concerned about how well the already endangered mammal (the non-sanctuary numbat population is estimated to be about 2,700) could adapt to increases in global average temperatures. Ecological physiologist Christine Cooper, lead author of the new research, said the numbats were overheating when their body reached about 40 degrees Celsius. And this was occurring when the wet bulb globe temperature — a measurement of heat stress factoring in temperature, humidity, wind speed and several other elements — hit about 23C. Most of the heat being absorbed was from the ground and environment around the numbats rather than just the solar heat. This means that even after retreating to shade in hot conditions, the marsupial can continue to warm up. Dr Cooper said it appeared that numbats already foraged in the early morning and later in the day during summer but warned global warming could change the animal's behaviour. ""If it gets hotter and hotter the windows for foraging will get narrower and narrower,"" she said. ""The rest period will need to get longer and they will be pushed to early morning and evening. ""That would expose them to predators."" University of Melbourne ecologist Natalie Briscoe, who was not involved in the research, said it was often thought hotter weather would primarily impact animals through heatwaves, but more subtle effects were also likely to be important. ""To be able to survive in a particular place, animals like numbats need to be able to be active for enough time to get the energy, water, and nutrients they need,"" Dr Briscoe said. ""While some animals like feral cats can adjust their activity timing seasonally to avoid stressful conditions during the daytime over summer, this may not be an option for more specialised species like the numbat."" The new research was based on drive-by surveys — numbats are notoriously hard to trap as you can't leave termites as bait and the critter has shown no taste for peanut butter or other typical lures — over 12 months. Dr Cooper and her colleague Phil Withers drove around the Dryandra Woodlands and Boyagin Nature Reserve, about 170 kilometres south-east of Perth. They pointed a thermal imaging camera at a numbat when they spotted one. A total of around 50 numbat videos were captured, spanning the whole year. The numbat's stripes were not found to have any significant thermal impacts, despite being patterned like a barbecue grill. Dr Cooper said the next stage of the research would be climate and habitat modelling to better understand which numbat populations could be at greater risk than others from hotter weather. Further research is also needed into how climate change might impact the behaviours of the termites the numbats eat. Numbats were once found across much of southern Australia including desert, woodland and more forested landscapes. Following widespread habitat clearing, and the introduction of predators like foxes and cats, their numbers skydived. Numbats were reduced to just two wild populations in the Dryandra Woodlands and another region of Western Australia, the Upper Warren. But in the past few decades, the wild population has been bolstered with translocations to sanctuaries in different parts of the numbat's historical range across WA, South Australia and New South Wales. Land managers of these habitats are increasingly having to consider the impacts of climate on where they send animals and for established communities. The WA Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions said it was taking into account longer-term factors such as climate change, habitat suitability and security of land tenure when translocating numbats. UNSW's Katherine Moseby is part of a project studying the effects of extreme heat at past numbat translocation sites: Secret Rocks in South Australia and the Australian Wildlife Conservancy's Mt Gibson Wildlife Sanctuary in WA. About 15 numbats were fitted with GPS collars and accelerometers, after being spotted and netted, which will provide more data on the kinds of shelters they use during heat waves. ""These studies provide really important field data to test biophysical models as extreme heat is likely to become a major factor structuring mammal communities in the arid and semi-arid zones,"" Dr Moseby said. ""We don't know if they can use torpor [go into a lethargic state] to save energy during hot weather down their burrows and this is something we hope to study."" Australian Wildlife Conservancy senior ecologist Jennifer Pierson said the WA project site had recorded days of 40C already this summer. She said understanding what shelters the numbats used, and when they used them, would help with not only managing current populations but other translocations. Numbats are just one of the five mammals the Australian Wildlife Conservancy has been subjecting to climate vulnerability risk assessments in its sanctuaries. ""We're hoping to move from being reactionary to proactive,"" Dr Pierson said. But Dr Pierson said managers had to be careful not to make things too easy for animals, and promoting animals with the genes to adapt to the conditions was important. For other mammals like the golden bandicoot, this has meant breeding specimens from the Kimberley (which has the greatest genetic diversity compared to other locations) with populations elsewhere in Australia.  ""It's about coming up with actions that hedge our bets a little bit,"" Dr Pierson said. ""So having that balance of making sure we allow animals to experience the natural environment but also acknowledge as things get tougher we're providing the support.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2024-01-12/hot-temperatures-too-much-for-australias-cutest-anteater/103307338
ts62,"At a breezy bush camp in the Kimberley, Raquel Teixeira is gazing into a mirror seeking a moment of truth. She inhales deeply and smiles quietly. ""There's change coming, and it's going to be huge,"" she says. ""The energy is growing … I can feel it everywhere, and I'm not the only one."" Raquel is among a growing number of people embracing a personalised set of new age spiritual practices and beliefs — a trend experts say was accelerated by the COVID pandemic. New age spiritualism is nothing new. It emerged in the 1970s as part of a counter-culture movement drawing upon nature worship, occultism, Asian philosophies, and alternative medicine. But recently the belief systems have intersected with social media, wellness trends, and conspiracy theories. Those beliefs are now being studied in detail in Australia for the first time. Part of the focus will be on ""conspirituality"", which is a term coined for the joining of new age spirituality and conspiracy theories. Lead researcher Anna Halafoff says the subject is poorly understood. ""I think there's a fair bit of misunderstanding around what's going on, particularly from the COVID pandemic period,"" she says. ""It's important we don't fall into that stereotype of spirituality being all 'peace, love and mung beans' – there's a lot more to it than that. ""We need to investigate the positives, but also the potential risks and harms of spirituality, as there's been comparatively less research than on the risks of religion."" New age spirituality is an umbrella term capturing a range of beliefs linked to the presence of a ""higher power"", spirits and a holistic form of divinity that pervades the universe and individuals. It's less hierarchical than organised religion, and more commonly practiced by women. Adherents are linked by language around spiritual tribes, healing, nature worship and communicating with spirits. It often involves mainstream wellness activities like yoga and meditation, as well as supernatural elements such as crystals, chakras, tarot cards, mediumship and astrology. Raquel Teixeira's worldview is typical of the movement. She says her priority is reconnecting with nature, infusing the world with positive energy, resisting capitalist and consumerist forces, and tapping into Indigenous knowledge systems to make sense of the world. ""We are all spiritual beings, journeying the human experience,"" she says. ""When I first came to Australia from Portugal I wasn't fully aware of that, but I had a strong desire to be free. ""Then it was like a big Pandora's Box opened, and I've gone deeper and deeper into trying to understand the world."" She lives in a bush block run by an Aboriginal community on the coast near Broome. Her camp is clean and basic, adorned with dream catchers and the smell of the native wood she burns to cleanse the site. Being immersed in nature and Aboriginal cultural practices is vital, she explains. ""There is a timelessness here,"" she says. ""I feel the most happy and most joyful I've ever felt, and also the most lonely and desperate. It's like a vortex that pulls you in the extremes of the experience of being human."" There's evidence young people are driving the increased interest in spirituality. A detailed survey of Generation Z people in Australia found twice as many teenagers considered themselves spiritual than religious. The study found almost a third of participants believed in ghosts, and a quarter believed in the possibility of communicating with the dead. Internationally, research shows there is still a higher percentage of women taking part in new age practices. Ms Halafoff is leading the first detailed study of these trends titled, Australian Spirituality: Wellness, Wellbeing and Risks. She says spirituality has more in common with organised religion than people might realise. ""With a lot of these practices, you still have a teacher, sometimes a charismatic leader, a set of beliefs and codes around what to eat, what to think, what not to think,"" she explains. ""Spirituality has also been increasingly the subject of concern when it comes to risks, in a similar way to religion, as there have been cases of abuse be that emotional, financial or sexual in spiritual communities also."" Experts such as Ms Halafoff say there are a range of factors contributing to the growth, including: Ms Halafoff says the movement is characterised by a disillusionment with modern society, and the ability of technology and governments to solve pressing global matters. ""Spirituality's traditionally been associated with women and wealthier people, and has probably been taken less seriously because of its association with women,"" she says. ""But the research shows it's not just white, inner city, rich women who are interested in this … and it was actually some men who became the most vocal in their beliefs during the COVID pandemic."" The study will look at the pandemic-fuelled phenomenon known as conspirituality – the fusion of spiritual beliefs and conspiracy theories. The term conspirituality was coined back in 2011, but gained currency during the pandemic years when authorities grappled with vocal anti-vaccine movements. The movement often focuses on a perceived battle between establishment forces and a 'new wave' of awakened people, endeavouring to be more connected with each other and the natural world. The narrative frames its followers as more enlightened than mainstream society, and prone to persecution. Ms Halafoff has written about a ""viral outbreak"" of conspirituality that begins as a non-violent critique of modern life, but in more extreme forms aligns with far-right views promoted by groups like QAnon — identified as a domestic terror threat by the FBI. ""Those with extreme and dangerous conspiritual views are a very small minority, but it's critical that we better understand their complexity and the processes of radicalisation."" During the COVID pandemic the movement spawned protests and radicalisation within Australia. And the most strident conspiracy theorist voices to emerge were men. Figures such as 'Aussie Warriors' Neil Pascoe and Nate Max came to prominence describing a ""COVID scamdemic … only held together by the mainstream news and fear"". They urged followers to ""get out onto the streets … to fight for the earth"", claiming that modern-day food, air, drinking water and phone towers were poisoning people. Celebrity Chef Pete Evans was typical of the non-violent conspiracy theory views espoused, ultimately being booted off Facebook and Instagram for spreading what was classified as misinformation. And there's evidence the movement tapped into broader distrust of mainstream health and media in Australia. A survey done in Australia during the pandemic found 13 per cent of adults believed COVID was not dangerous and was being used as a way to force vaccinations – that figure rose to 20 per cent among young people. Ms Halafoff says her team's early research suggests only a very small portion of people with new age spiritual beliefs were involved. They conducted a small-scale pilot survey during the pandemic, of people who considered themselves spiritual people or involved in the wellness industry. ""Only a very small minority of people — about five per cent — held conspiratorial views and were vaccine resistant,"" Ms Halafoff says. ""Most of the people surveyed did not have any conspiratorial views in terms of global elites or 5G networks being responsible for the virus, and supported lockdowns and mask-wearing. ""So I think we need to be really careful not to tar everyone who's involved in wellness with so-called 'woo-anon'."" Her team's now embarking on a three-year, federally-funded research project that will look in more detail at the demographics of those promoting conspiritualist views in Australia, and the risk factors associated, such as radicalisation. Academics point out there are tensions at the core of both mainstream spirituality and conspirituality. The movements are critical of consumerism, yet drive a lucrative, large-scale economy based on retreats and retail. But as Australians increasingly shift online to communicate and source ideas, it's likely the rejection of traditional institutions like church, banks and government will continue. ""We're in an upside world. I was in hospital recently, and I realised some things,"" says Raquel. ""We are sick because we are disconnected from the mother, disconnected from nature. The medical system exists in a loop with the diseases, and we're not addressing the root cause of our sickness."" Raquel is keen to focus on the positives of connecting with the universe, but is happy to discuss the concept of conspiritualism. She chose not to be vaccinated or take COVID tests, viewing the pandemic as a natural cleansing process that was required on a global level. ""The way I see it – and this can be hard to explain — it was an activation, a purging within our being of density and energy that needed to be released,"" she says. ""It's part of a transformation period that we're all going through. ""It forced upon human beings a pause – the rivers were clear, the air was clean, and that was a realisation of how quickly we can shift realities."" The term conspiracy theory doesn't sit comfortably with her. Raquel says she understands the power of words in shaping a narrative and references ""dark forces"", linked to negative energies, causing sickness and conflict. ""The more we open our chakras to be receiving and experiencing life as multi-galactic and eternal beings, we realise there's a lot happening on the 'dark side' that we're not seeing yet,"" she says. ""There are what you have called conspiracies that are shown to us in a little moments in the journey. ""It's true that the world is hurting, and mankind is existing in a way that's not conscious and not harmonious."" ""I do see the dark forces, but it's just important to remain grounded in what I can see and experience every day, as it can distract from the essence of what's important."" Raquel's priority for now is living with ""purity"" – that is, with clean, healthy eating, minimal involvement in the capitalist economy, and nurturing close and creative connections with people. She doesn't have a regular job, preferring to trade labour for goods. There are the occasional cash injections from babysitting, cleaning or dancing. ""I would never judge people who think or feel differently to me,"" she reflects. ""The main thing for me is to keep finding beauty and connecting honestly with people. ""Life is not about trying to be happy all the time ... it's about embracing all of the things, all of the feelings, and being honest about that journey.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-30/new-age-conspiritualism-focus-of-new-australian-research/102698964
ts63,"The queues resembled a rush to buy tickets for a football match or concert, but those lining up for hours simply wanted to leave the country as soon as possible. After last week's announcement of compulsory military service for Myanmar youngsters, the Thai embassy in Yangon was flooded with requests for tourist visas. They were hoping to travel over the border before the chance of being conscripted as they weighed up their options in Thai cities like Bangkok or Chiang Mai. ""I will go to Bangkok with a tourist visa and hope to stay there for a while,"" 20-year-old Aung Phyo told AFP. ""I haven't decided yet to work or study. I just wanted to escape from this country."" Aung, a student, said he arrived at the embassy at 8pm and slept in his car before starting to queue about midnight ahead of its opening at 9am the following day. ""We had to wait for three hours and police opened the security gate around 3am and we had to run to the front of the embassy to try to get places for a token,"" Aung said, using a pseudonym because of fears for his safety. ""After we got a token, people who didn't get one were still queuing in front of the embassy, hoping they might give out extras."" Last Friday, a queue of between 1,000 and 2,000 people snaked through the streets of Yangon towards the embassy, compared with fewer than 100 before last week's announcement. Myanmar authorities said they would enforce a law allowing it to call up all men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 to serve in the military for at least two years, as it struggles to quell opposition to its 2021 coup. The junta has said it is taking measures to arm pro-military militias as it battles opponents across the country — both anti-coup ""People's Defence Forces"" and more long-standing armed groups belonging to ethnic minorities. Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said the military service system was needed ""because of the situation happening in our country"". More than 4,500 people have been killed in the military's crackdown on dissent since its February 2021 coup and over 26,000 arrested, according to a local monitoring group. The conscription law, which is due to begin in April, was first introduced in 2010 but had not been enforced until the recent announcement by Myanmar's junta. It comes after the junta lost control of swathes of territory along a frontline that stretches from the highlands bordering China to the coastline near Bangladesh, some of it in a coordinated offensive by rebel groups that started in October, dubbed Operation 1027. ""The military is clearly facing significant manpower shortages, which is why it is introducing a draft for the first time in its history,"" said Richard Horsey, the Crisis Group's senior Myanmar adviser. Ye Myo Hein, senior advisor to the United States Institute of Peace think-tank, assessed most military battalions are struggling to meet even half the recommended troop strength of 200 soldiers. ""There has been a notable decline in the number of officer enlistments as well,"" he said. ""Additionally, the loss of officers, including brigadier generals … have been significantly higher due to shrinking battalion sizes and decreasing rank-and-file soldiers."" Last year, Ye Myo Hein estimated the Myanmar military had around 70,000 combat soldiers, citing interviews with military deserters and defectors, analysis of military documents and casualty counts. Neighbouring Thailand is a familiar destination for Myanmar, with Yangon only 420 kilometres from the border. According to the 2014 Myanmar Census, almost 1.5 million former residents live in Thailand, with Samut Sakhon province home to more than 200,000 Burmese migrants. Thailand is home to about 70 per cent of Myanmar's overseas population and also has nine official refugee camps in border areas, containing 150,000 Burmese refugees.  Wires/ABC",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/myanmar-conscription-thailand-leaving-junta-visas-burma/103482964
ts64,"Former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been released from prison on parole just six months after his dramatic return to the kingdom from 15 years of self-imposed exile. The 74-year-old, twice elected premier and ousted in a 2006 military coup, was jailed for eight years on corruption and abuse-of-power charges upon his return to Thailand last August. But his sentence was cut to one year by King Maha Vajiralongkorn within days of his return and the government announced last week that the disgraced former billionaire was eligible for early release because of his age and health. Thaksin, wearing a neck brace, his right arm in a sling and a face mask, was seen with his children in a van leaving Bangkok's Police General Hospital at 6:09am local-time.  He was released before dawn despite the presence of more than 100 demonstrators, who had condemned what they saw as special treatment given to the convicted former prime minister by justice authorities. A day earlier, Thailand's current prime minister Srettha Thavisin had announced that Thaksin would be freed on Sunday. Thai media reported Thaksin's release was subject to monitoring. He is required to report to parole officers for the remainder of his sentence and there are restrictions on his right to travel. However, he will not be required to wear an ankle monitor because he is over 70. The former Manchester City football team owner's homecoming came on the same day his Pheu Thai party returned to government in alliance with pro-military parties, leading many to conclude that a backroom deal had been struck to cut his jail time. The rumours about Thaksin's early release grew stronger when he was transferred to a police hospital within hours of being sentenced because of his poor health. He was reportedly suffering from chest tightness and high blood pressure when he was admitted to hospital, and his family have said he underwent two operations in the following months. The government has denied any deal and Srettha, of the Pheu Thai party, has insisted ""he already served his jail time"" — although it is not clear that Thaksin has spent any time in a prison cell. The former telecoms tycoon is one of the most influential yet divisive figures in modern Thailand history. Thaksin was loved by millions of rural Thais for his populist policies in the early 2000s but has long been reviled by the country's royalist and pro-military establishment. The tussle for dominance between the establishment and Thaksin and his allies has largely defined Thai politics during the past two decades. Police laid lese-majeste charges against him last week over comments he made in South Korea almost a decade ago, although it is not clear whether prosecutors will take the case to court. His critics suspected him of pulling strings in the kingdom even from exile, which he spent mostly in Dubai before his return. Thaksin's sister Yingluck Shinawatra was elected prime minister for Pheu Thai in 2011, only to be ousted in a coup herself in 2014. And his daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra, now the party's chief at the age of just 37, was one of the leading faces in its campaign for last year's general election and has been tipped as a possible future prime minister. Paetongtarn, who travelled with her father back from the hospital, said on Instagram: ""Thaksin has arrived home, hope he will have good health."" The election last May marked the first time in more than 20 years that a Thaksin-linked party failed to win the most seats in parliament. Pheu Thai was beaten into second place by the upstart progressive Move Forward Party (MFP). But conservative forces in the senate blocked MFP's leader Pita Limjaroenrat from becoming prime minister, and Pheu Thai's deal with military-linked parties then shut the newcomers out of government. Thaksin served more than five years as prime minister before being deposed in a military coup on 19 September 2006. Apart from a short visit in 2008, he lived in self-imposed exile for 15 years before returning to Thailand last year. Thakin's great-grandfather, Seng Saekhu, was an immigrant from Guangdong in China, who arrived in the 1860s before settling in Chiang Mai, where Thaksin was born in 1949. Studying in the US, he earned a masters in criminal justice from Eastern Kentucky University, and worked at a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet. Before launching his business career, Thaksin trained as a police officer and reached the rank of lieutenant colonel, before that was revoked in September 2015. While in exile, Thaksin bought English Premier League club Manchester City in 2007 for 81.6 million pounds ($157 million) before selling it the following year to Abu Dhabi United Group for a reported 200 million pounds ($385 million). Entering politics in 1994, Thaksin quickly became Thailand's foreign minister. But he soon left the Palang Dharma Party, forming the populist Thai Rak Thai (TRT) Party in 1998, promising cheap loans, utilities' subsidies, price guarantees for farmers and universal health care, making him the darling of rural voters. A homemade banner with the words ""Welcome home"" and ""We've been waiting for this day for so so long"" was seen hanging at the front gate of Thaksin's residence in western Bangkok. But his legal problems may not be behind him. If the attorney-general decides to indict him for allegedly defaming the monarchy, Thaksin could be detained again.

ts65,"""Don't ever marry a BMW,"" I overheard at a family friend's event.  ""A what?"" ""A Black, Muslim or White,"" they replied. That wasn't the last time I heard that phrase. In many South Asian communities, acceptance of interracial relationships is hard to come by. Indian Australian Pooja has experienced this first-hand.  The Melbourne woman met her partner, a white Australian, on a dating app in 2021, ""without any intention of getting serious"". ""Despite not expecting it, we fell in love,"" she tells the ABC. But there wasn't any love for the relationship from Pooja's parents, who live in India.  Pooja and her family are Hindus, while her partner was raised as a Christian but is now atheist.  She says this was ""the main problem"" for her parents.  ""[My parents] are scared of new things and don't want to change their ways."" Pooja says without her family's support, every aspect of her relationship has been challenging. ""At 27 years old, I'm stuck between being honest and not wanting to upset my parents, so I end up hiding things from them."" Pooja only told her parents about her relationship for the first time in 2023. The couple are now living together, but her parents don't know this. ""They aren't happy about the relationship, which is why I can't tell them I live with him,"" she says.  It's a desolate reality for Pooja and many other women in the same situation, who have dreams of making life plans with their partner.  ""We dream of getting married and starting our own family,"" she says.  ""But the thought of discussing it with my parents gives me anxiety because they're not very open-minded and they may never accept my life choices or worse, disown me. ""I have to keep lying to them, which takes a toll on my mental health. ""They care more about staying comfortable, even if it means ignoring what makes me happy."" But why is that? Some experts say it boils down to collectivist societies versus individualist ones. ""Western society tends to be more individualistic and non-hierarchical,"" according to Connie Zheng, an associate professor at the University of South Australia.  ""Whereas Asian society is collectivist and hierarchical,"" Dr Zheng tells the ABC.  ""This means collectivist countries such as India often shape their social structures to support community, family and society, rather than individuals."" Clinical psychologist Jyothsna Bhat echoes that. For many children of South Asian immigrants, balancing parents' expectations along with their own is a life-long process, says Dr Bhat.  ""Many expectations in the diaspora are fuelled by factors of gender, sexism, religion, or cultural ideologies,"" she wrote in a report last month.  ""These extend into familial duties/gender roles, career choices, marriage, and family planning."" Priya, who was born in Gujarat and now lives in Perth, understands that all too well. She was raised in a Hindu household. But she says she ""no longer resonates with any religious groups"". Eight months ago, Priya met her Zimbabwean partner on a dating app. ""I'm the happiest I’ve ever been,"" she says.  But Priya's parents were not aware about her relationship until very recently, when she visited them in India late last year.  She says she disclosed her relationship because she ""wanted them to be a part of her happiness"". ""I broke the news to them on my second day of the trip. They did not take it well and are still not in support of the relationship,"" she says.  ""Their main concerns are rooted in racism and the way the Indian community views 'black people'."" Dr Bhat's research on colourism in South Asia mirrors Priya's words. ""South Asian kids learn early on that Eurocentric features, such as fair skin, are the keys to power,"" Dr Bhat wrote.  ""Often the darker-skinned members in a family would be singled out and harassed with nicknames."" India's billion-dollar skin-whitening industry, which largely governs the country's ideas of beauty, is testament of this. Priya says at the forefront of her parents' concerns is the infamous question: ""What will people say?""  ""It is sad to witness your parents caring more about the society and the community's reaction than your child's happiness,"" Priya says.  Priya thinks the pushback she is receiving from her family will go on ""for months or years to come"". It's part of the reason why the couple won't move in together yet. ""As much as he would love for us to live together, he understands my hesitation with it and is in support for us to move in together once we're married.""  Rusha (not her real name), a Hindu woman from San Francisco, met her partner, a white American, during her first year of college. They've been together for nine-and-a-half years.  ""My mum has come around from the beginning, but I still have issues with my father not accepting the relationship on the grounds of religion,"" she tells the ABC. When her parents started to realise her relationship was serious, they ""got fixated on the cultural differences"". ""They strongly believe that cultural differences will cause huge issues down the line, especially when it comes to having kids. ""My parents believe that similar backgrounds and values are the 'recipe to a successful marriage'."" Rusha says moving in with her partner was a major issue they had to negotiate. ""When we first decided to live together, I didn't tell my parents because I knew they would disapprove,"" she says.  ""But after going back and forth with them so much, my partner and I ended up compromising for my parents by getting a two-bedroom apartment. ""It's to show them that my partner and I sleep separately."" Over the years, Rusha says she has felt ""enormous amounts of guilt"" when she distances herself from her parents. ""It affects my mental health because I feel a lot of obligation towards taking care of my parents as an only child."" While Rusha's parents know that it's inevitable she and her partner will get married, they ""don't actively participate"" in her relationship. ""They don't seem to want to be a part of a life in which I am with my partner. ""They only want to spend time with me, not us, together."" For six years, Pakistani Muslim woman Huda has been with her white, American partner.  But for more than half of those years, her family had no idea.  ""Race/ethnicity and religion is very important to my parents, so I didn't tell them,"" she says. ""For four-to-five years, we hid from the world and that wasn't fair to my husband or I. ""Not being able to share photos of us on social media and not being open and honest with my family — these were some of the hardest parts."" After they eloped, Huda and her partner moved in together, against her family's wishes.  ""My family knew it was happening and we tried our best to give them ample time to process and adjust but eventually we had to move forward with our own lives."" Huda says her parents expected her to pass on the same religion and culture to her future kids, with a partner with the same background as her. She believes that South Asian parents do this out of the belief that their kids will ""better succeed in life"". ""As a parent, you set all these criteria and expectations for your kids in the context of how they can live successfully,"" she says.  ""In the end, me marrying an American is something unfamiliar to them because it is so out of bounds from their perspective."" Unlike many others in her situation, most of Huda's Pakistani Muslim relatives and friends have been very supportive, she says.  ""Things have also cleared up with my father for the most part. However, my mother doesn't keep in communication. ""Being cut off like this was incredibly hard for me."" Huda says while she is happy now, it was difficult to ""let go of my anger towards religion, culture, and my family"". ""It was essential to my wellbeing that I let go of it.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/south-asian-women-interracial-relationship-couple-parents/103454738
ts66,"When housemates Sophie Rindfleish and Sofie Spelta started up an Instagram page for their small running club last year, they hadn't expected it to blow up. ""We had a video go viral ... that's when it started to go crazy,"" Ms Spelta says. Dubbed the ""SoSo's"" running club and based in the northern suburbs of Brisbane, the group initially had a dozen participants. Last week, it surpassed 500 runners with more than 19,000 Instagram followers.  ""Seeing people who couldn't run more than a few hundred metres now being able to finish a five or 10-kilometre run is just so nice to see,"" Ms Rindfleish says.  Hundreds of community-driven running clubs have popped up across the country, with organisers attributing their success to viral and catchy social media video content. On a humid evening in central Queensland, about 50 runners gather outside a pub in downtown Rockhampton with one thing on their mind: steak. ""Run and Rump"" is a new running club in the beef capital of Queensland where each Wednesday participants meet at a different pub, complete a 5km run, and then enjoy a rump steak.  Organisers of the group Sam Plath and Lucy Blair say the group has grown from 15 weekly runners last year, and to up to 60 participants. ""Hopefully we can keep continuing to grow,"" Ms Plath says.  A running club in Adelaide's inner north has also seen its popularity skyrocket, with the number of members doubling in the past six months. Founder of the ""Prospect"" running club Oliver Neate says he thinks more people had picked up the sport after the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Or perhaps it reignited their interest in running,"" Mr Neate says.  Ms Spelta says social media posts about running clubs across the country have been going viral. ""I honestly think that's because it looks like something fun, once you go once, you keep going,"" she says. ""Run and Rump"" has seen major growth since Ms Blair started their Instagram account a few weeks ago. ""Being able to see what it would be like to join a run club before coming in person, I think really helps people to get the courage to come along,"" Ms Blair says.  ""They can see it is not that intimidating, and we are just here to connect and meet new people, and we don't mind how fast or slow you run at all."" University of Queensland researcher Michael Noetel says running clubs are so effective because they provide both support and accountability. ""When you're struggling at the end of the run or struggling for motivation, people are there to help you,"" Dr Noetel says. ""If you don't turn up or you don't do it on a certain week, someone is going to notice, and that makes a huge difference."" A report, recently published by Dr Noetel, found exercise to be just as beneficial as therapy and medication for treating depression. ""[Exercising] in a group setting where you have some support or accountability ... will make a huge difference in terms of reducing your depression symptoms,"" he said.  Ms Rindfleish says running alongside other people can offer a distraction. ""You're running and chatting with someone the whole way, and you don't even realise that you have run 5km,"" she says. Ms Blair says it the regular runs have helped her reconnect, after returning to her home town of Rockhampton a month ago. ""It has been life-changing,"" she says. ""It has made moving regionally really exciting and I have met so many people through it already.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-19/running-clubs-growing-popularity-social-media-support/103456610
ts67,"For cancer patient Kevin Wayne Keating, the sound of classical music is a welcome escape from the harsh reality of his condition. As he lies in bed at the Gold Coast University's oncology ward, he delights in listening to a string quartet made up of local medical students. ""I've got various things happening inside my body that grow and probably eventually put an end to you,"" Mr Keating said. ""What better way to go out than to the beautiful sounds of these young people in the string quartet? ""I thought I was in the wrong place. ""I thought, 'I'm not in a concert hall — it's live music,' as you can always tell live music as compared to something that comes out of electronics and speakers, and then I realised it was happening outside my door."" Amy Lee, Jaewon Lee, Yi Jiun Chan, Ryo Takamizawa perform fortnightly for patients at the oncology ward at the Gold Coast University Hospital. ""Sometimes we get requests from the patients, which is always exciting,"" Mr Takamizawa said. ""We spend an hour playing for patients. ""Sometimes we go into their rooms and the hope is that we can give them joy and hope to their wonderful days."" The students decided to volunteer after the hospital put a call-out for talented artists to join their Musicians in Clinical Spaces program last year. Laura Strange, who leads the program, said the quartet was a hit with patients, visitors and staff. ""The music really does give them a sense of joy, a sense of community and belonging, and that's for both the people listening but also the people playing the music,"" she said. The students say the music gives them relief too. ""It's kind of like my escape mechanism from all the stress from studying,"" Ms Lee said. ""It's something that I've been enjoying since I was young, and getting together with my friends who are studying the same thing … we have the passion of music that we share together and it's just something that I gain a lot out of."" Ms Chan said the artform helped her unwind. ""Music for me, personally, is a way for me to reduce anxiety and provides a sense of comfort and relaxation,"" she said. Bond University professor William Forde Thompson said music helped people disengage from challenges in their lives. ""When you engage in music, there's something called ego dissolution, where you stop thinking about yourself as an individual and you start thinking in broader ways, which can really help people who are facing something like cancer,"" he said. ""If somebody is facing a difficult diagnosis, they're undergoing treatment for something, it's scary and music sort of takes you outside of yourself. ""You don't really think about the problems that you have, and there's also a kind of timelessness about music, so it gives you perspective."" Balancing university commitments with volunteer work can be a stretch, but Mr Takamizawa said the sacrifice was worth it. ""We do it because we truly believe that we are contributing to the health of the patients,"" he said. ""Health is not just an absence of disease, it's a state of complete social, emotional, cultural wellbeing, and I think that's the important thing, especially given that [for] people in oncology wards, this may be some of the trying times in their lives.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/gold-coast-medical-students-form-cancer-ward-string-quartet/103475408
ts68,"Public libraries are typically places people visit to escape into a good book, but for some it has become a different kind of safe haven. Whether it is to get out of harsh weather and avoid high energy bills, seek advice on social services or find social connection, libraries have become a community support hub that some experts say should be funded as such.  Corangamite Moyne Library Service coordinator Kat Wilson, who has worked in libraries across Victoria for more than 10 years, says people seek help with everything from formatting resumes to ""much more challenging things"" like dealing with Centrelink or Medicare online. She says library staff know their communities and have great networks. ""It's not actually our job to help any of these people, but it's our job to connect them with the kind of help they're looking for,"" Ms Wilson said. ""One of my staff … had somebody come in and, in helping them with their resume, learnt about other needs they had and were able to connect them with a local support network for a food hamper."" Ms Wilson said staff could assist with ""really small town stuff"", such as calling an op shop to find an outfit for a job interview, or encouraging a new family in town to come along to community events and meet new people. ""We don't have a judgement on what you're trying to access. We just want to help you find what you need,"" she said. Charles Sturt University lecturer and researcher Dr Jane Garner said public library workers were well positioned to help people with all sorts of complex needs. She wants councils to recognise the role libraries play as a first point of contact for many people experiencing issues such as homelessness, mental illness and addiction. ""Libraries have always been a place where the front door's open, the lights are on, everybody's welcome,"" Dr Garner said. ""It's a place you can sit all day without someone telling you to buy something or to move on. ""Library staff know their people. They know what their normal is and, when something becomes obviously different to that, then they're able to spot that and make a move to get something sorted out for them. She said they were not ""just giving out books anymore"". ""They're also giving out social services and the funding to libraries has to reflect that,"" Dr Garner said. In 2019, City of Melbourne Libraries became the first Australian public library service to employ a social worker on-site. Surveys showed the move helped library staff feel more confident when responding to people with complex needs and referring them to someone with relevant qualifications and experience. Dr Garner said the presence of a social worker in libraries also benefited librarians' mental health. ""They've now got a mechanism to talk to somebody if they've had a challenging experience looking after somebody,"" she said. ""But also I think the main impact that it's had on library staff is that they no longer feel like they're a dead end."" Dr Garner said as government and financial services moved online, more people went to libraries for help with medical appointments, housing assistance and banking, which could lead to confidentiality issues.  ""Now if you go to Centrelink and say, 'I want to go on the housing list'. They'll say, 'Here's a URL. You can go onto that website and register yourself and fill out a form', and then they'll send them away,"" she said. ""There's nowhere there for them to do that work, so the library is the place that they'll come because that's the only place you can get free access to a computer and the internet and somebody who will sit there with you and help you type it in."" While not all libraries can or will employ a social worker, Dr Garner says there are other ways to support staff, such as learning from other ""first responder-type professions"". She said librarians could also be trained in ""life skills and resilience … [to] give them a more accurate view of the workplaces that we're sending them out to"". ""We have to look after their wellbeing better, because they are at the front line of all our community's social problems,"" Dr Garner said.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-17/libraries-community-support-hubs-for-social-support-services/103441200
ts69,"Scientist and broadcaster Dr Karl Kruszelnicki says there are some benefits to hot and cold therapy, but the science behind some of the more sensational claims are ""lukewarm"" at best. Saunas and ice plunges have been hailed by some as a fast track to wellness, said to improve everything from life span to sex life. They have risen in popularity due to the endorsement of high-profile internet posts by people including ""The Iceman"" Wim Hof and prolific podcasters Joe Rogan and Andrew Huberman. Male self-optimisers, known to the internet as ""Huberman Husbands"" claims to start their days with an icy shower and end it with a post-gym sauna and cold plunge. Dr Karl said cold exposure was beneficial for cuts, delayed onset muscle soreness and osteoarthritis. However, he said there were many claims not backed by solid scientific evidence. ""There is some degree of usefulness in hot or cold therapy for certain types of injury for 20 minutes at a time, but specifically only those,"" Dr Karl said. ""However, I am kind of lukewarm on it as a cure for everything including sunstroke, syphilis, varicose veins and bad handwriting."" ""[Cold] reduces inflammation, yes, but sometimes you want a bit of inflammation because it can act as a local anaesthetic and it's good for recent injuries, sprains, and tendonitis."" Dr Karl said long-term hot therapy had some usefulness, since it could open up blood vessels and remove metabolites such as lactic acid. He said this can be beneficial for muscle sprains, strains, tendonitis, and warming up stiff muscles. Dr Karl said Wim Hof's identical twin showed high tolerance to cold, which suggested Wim Hof's remarkable cold tolerance was genetic and not developed over time. Tim Thomas starts each day with breathing exercises inside a bath full of ice, which he describes as so blissful as to be ""almost religious"". The former Special Forces commando was diagnosed with PTSD and he now works with veterans who have depression, anxiety and health problems. He said for him, ice baths were a way to achieve mental clarity and be feel more in the moment. ""There are parts of us that are disempowered and they're always in the back of our head, like background programs running in a computer,"" Mr Thomas said. ""When I get into the ice a few minutes later those disempowered parts are gone, all those background programs cleared, so I have so much more energy for what I want to do with my world."" Dr Karl said people should be cautious moving from extremes of hot to cold. He said in very hot environments the 100,000 kilometres of blood vessels in the human skin opened only to rapidly shut again when the body was plunged in ice. In the opposite case when moving from extreme cold to hot, Dr Karl said blood pressure could fall so fast that temporary vasodilation was induced and the person fainted. ""It is nice to jump into the ocean where it's not freezing cold, that's fine,"" Dr Karl said. ""But making it a religion to go to zero?

ts70,"Americans testing positive for COVID-19 will no longer be told to stay home for five days under new rules proposed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), local media has reported.  It will be the first time since 2021 that the CDC has loosened its isolation recommendations, according to the Washington Post, which cited multiple agency officials and internal communications.  Under its new approach, people would decide when to end isolation based on their own symptoms, and wouldn't need to stay home if they have been fever-free for at least 24-hours without medication.  The White House has yet to sign off on the guidance, which officials told Washington Post is expected to be released in April for public feedback.  The New York Times reported two people ""with knowledge"" of discussions had confirmed the change was still under consideration.  A CDC spokesperson told the ABC the organisation had ""no updates to COVID guidelines to announce at this time"". ""We will continue to make decisions based on the best evidence and science to keep communities healthy and safe,"" they said.  Following these reports, the ABC contacted Australia's Department of Health for an update on what it could mean for Australians in coming months.  Here's what they had to say.  When it comes to isolation recommendations, the Department of Health and Aged Care says states and territories ""have primary operational responsibility for emergency management and public health"" in each jurisdiction.  ""This includes the responsibility for COVID-19 isolation requirements,"" a department spokesperson told the ABC.  ""The Australian government continues to recommend that people who test positive to COVID-19 stay at home and avoid contact with people who are at higher risk of severe disease.""  While isolation is no longer a legal requirement, Australians who test positive for COVID-19 should also avoid ""high-risk settings"" like hospitals and care facilities for at least seven days ""or until symptoms have gone"".  The department also recommends avoiding contact with people vulnerable to the disease, wearing a mask and working from home whenever possible.  Asked what a ""realistic"" approach might look like in an Australian setting, they said Australia's chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, had declared COVID-19 ""no longer a communicable disease incident of national significance"".  ""Australia has shifted to managing COVID-19 consistent with other common communicable diseases, focusing on prevention, reducing transmission and management of serious illness, hospitalisations and death,"" the spokesperson said.  Here's what each health department across Australia recommends when it comes to isolation.  There are no mandatory isolation rules or restrictions on household contacts in the ACT, but ""you should still stay at home and take steps to protect those around you"".  The ACT's Department of Health recommends practising ""COVID Smart behaviours"", including:  Queensland Health ""strongly recommends"" staying at home until you have no acute respiratory symptoms, have gone at least 24 hours without a fever (without using fever-reducing medications) and at least five days have passed.  The department also recommends: There are no requirements in NSW for self isolation, but the state's Department of Health says it is ""strongly recommended"" to stay home until symptoms are gone.  It notes you should avoid gatherings and indoor crowded locations, and not visit vulnerable people, hospitals or residential care facilities for at least seven days.  Victoria's Department of Health recommends isolating ""until five days after the date of the positive test result for COVID-19 and until resolution of acute symptoms"".  It also recommends people should not leave isolation for work, school, or to visit a high-risk location for at least seven days and until acute symptoms have subsided.  You should have a negative rapid antigen test (RAT) result before visiting ""any healthcare facility, residential care facility or person at high risk of illness"".  But the department also notes a negative RAT result ""should be interpreted in conjunction with the case's symptoms and duration of illness"".  You should notify all close contacts and social contacts at home, work and school if you came into contact with them during the infectious period.  Tasmania's Department of Health recommends staying home ""if you have ongoing respiratory symptoms"".  It added people should take extra precautions in the days after testing positive to minimise their risk of spreading the disease.  NT Health recommends people stay home while they're unwell and showing symptoms.  ""Talk to your employer about when you should return to the workplace,"" the department's guidelines say.  ""If you work in a high-risk setting such as health, disability and aged care, you may be required to protect staff, patients, residents and clients.""  They also recommend you:  SA Health recommends isolating until acute symptoms have cleared, ""usually five to seven days"".  It also recommends:  WA's Department of Health recommends isolating until symptoms have cleared up, noting ""this could take up to 10 days or more and a minimum of five days is a good guide"".  After testing positive you should avoid high-risk settings ""including hospitals, disability, mental health and aged care residential facilities"".  Changes in testing and reporting requirements mean Australia's figures are likely underestimated, according to Professor Kelly. ""When you look at the official figures of cases, that reflects what's happening in the community and it's helpful for monitoring, but it's not the total story,"" he told the ABC last month.  ""There is definitely more cases in the community than are being officially reported."" The dominant variant across Australia is called JN.1. In early January this variant prompted warnings from several states, but experts have said there's no evidence it's more severe than other variants.  JN.1 directly evolved from BA.2.86, the 2023 ""Pirola"" variant which emerged in August 2023, ultimately stemming from the Omicron variant.  Research suggests it is significantly more infectious than other variants.  ""The JN.1 variant appears to have become a dominant circulating variant in Australia and globally,"" the Department of Health spokesperson told the ABC.  ""In the 28-day period to 4 February 2024, JN.1 sequences constituted two thirds of all uploaded sequences in AusTrakka, Australia's genomics surveillance system.

The permits were signed on Friday and by Saturday the Nine Eagle was getting loaded with cattle at Darwin Port and is now on its way to Jakarta. ""There are choppers in the air, trucks on the road, and ships on the water,"" Troy Setter, the chief executive of Consolidated Pastoral Company, said. ""I think it's quite a big relief not just for cattle producers and exporters from Australia, but also importers in Indonesia who were starting to face pressure from customers."" Mr Setter said Indonesia had issued permits to import around 650,000 head of Australian cattle this year. ABC Rural has been told import permits were flowing for some other commodities, such as tables grapes, but Australia's boxed beef trade was understood to be still finalising details. Mr Setter said the length of the delay in getting import permits this year was unprecedented and had been very costly for many in the live export supply chain. ""I was in Darwin last week and drove past a trucking depot with a lot of trucks not moving, which means a lot of drivers are not getting an income,"" he said. ""So in both Indonesia and Australia, there were a lot of people out of work for six or seven weeks who weren't expecting it."" He said, during the delay, live exporters had ships anchored near Darwin Harbour for weeks paying demurrage costs of between $30,000 and $76,000 a day plus the cost of cattle waiting in export yards. He said with Ramadan starting next month, he was expecting the trade with Indonesia to be busy, with strong demand for slaughter-ready cattle. Feeder steers to Indonesia via the Darwin Port are getting around $3.20 to $3.40 a kilogram, which is up 30 per cent on prices last October. Queensland livestock agent Liam Kirkwood said cattle were being sourced for a shipment out of Townsville next week. ""There is a preference for heavier cattle, so from 380 kilograms right up to 600 kilograms,"" he said. ""Obviously with the delay in getting these permits out, the importers have a deadline with their [religious festivals like Ramadan], so they need cattle in suitable slaughter condition."" He said live export prices to Indonesia (ex-Charters Towers) were between $3.10 to $3.30 a kilogram for slaughter-ready steers.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2024-02-19/indonesia-issues-live-cattle-export-trade-permits/103483132
ts72,"Wine growers in New South Wales are celebrating after reporting a 50 per cent increase in yields amid renewed optimism that China's tariffs on the industry will be lifted. Concerns remain, however, over an oversupply of grapes that is pushing prices down, in particular for red wine producers. Winery owner Nick Segger said while harvest would continue until the end of March, quality and quantity were up from previous years. ""The yield so far has been really good and we are really happy with the quality,"" he said. ""From what we have seen both in the winery from the grapes that have been picked and what we are seeing on the vine currently, we are all really excited about what the 2024 vintage is going to bring."" Mr Segger, the president of the Orange Vignerons Association in NSW's central west, said conditions could not have been better for growers over summer, with consistent rainfall and warm temperatures. ""That has presented some really nice conditions. It is hard to compare one year to another, but at the moment I think a lot of people around the region are really excited."" In the Hunter Valley, wine grower Bruce Tyrrell saw the yield fall by up to 30 per cent compared with last year.  However, with the majority of wine in the Hunter Valley going to high-end markets and an oversupply impacting the industry, Mr Tyrrell said the key behind this year's vintage was a considerable improvement in quality.  ""The reds have got great colour and flavours,"" he said.  ""They are going to be some super wines. I know we say that every vintage, but this year it is for real.""  It comes as Australia's trade minister, Don Farrell, prepares to meet with his Chinese counterpart later this month, with trade blocks on seafood and wine a point of discussion. In 2020, China introduced a 218 per cent tax on imports of Australian wine that caused the $1.2 billion trade industry to the country to collapse. There are hopes this month's meeting will lead to the removal of the tariffs as early as March. ""It could mean up to a 20 per cent increase in sales, which would be very handy right at the moment,"" Mr Tyrrell said.  Since the tariffs were introduced, producers have attempted to diversify the country's export market, with an increase in sales to the UK, Europe and North America.  Despite this, exports have fallen from a record high of 852 million litres in 2018 to 621 million litres in 2023, according to Wine Australia. Mr Tyrrell said it highlighted the importance China still played in the wine industry.  ""We have gone out and found lots of other markets; in the past 12 months, seven new markets have opened but nothing is as big as China.  ""If they don't start buying again, then there is probably a massive restructure for the Australian wine industry required.""  According to Rabobank Australia, there is currently a two-billion-litre oversupply of wine in Australia. With exports falling by 231 million litres over the past six years, this has flooded the Australian market.  It resulted in the average value for inland red wine in 2023 falling to $304 per tonne, the lowest price ever seen. Griffith-based producer and Riverina Winegrape Growers chairman Bruno Brombal said they had had a fantastic harvest with yields up 50 per cent from last season.  But despite the positive picking for many, the glut in the market was pushing people out of the industry, he said. ""Prices are so low that it is not sustainable; growers are in danger of getting out of the industry."" Mr Brombal believes the opening of Chinese markets will go some way to alleviating the pressure on the sector, but changes need to be made to prevent gluts in the market. ""We are hoping this year is rock bottom and next year it will come back with China opening the export market again, but we need to lose probably 25 per cent of our wine grapes in Australia to go back to a balance.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2024-02-19/wine-producers-report-bumper-harvest-ahead-of-china-trade-talks/103464188

Just a day later, Ms Davis's three other working dogs started vomiting and shaking. She suspects all four dogs, living near the south-west WA town of Harvey, had been poisoned. ""We thought it's not a coincidence that this is all happening. We took them to the vet and confirmed they had been poisoned,"" Ms Davis said. ""My boyfriend's dog [Barra] unfortunately had to be put down as kidney failure had just gone too far. ""[The dogs] are not just my family, they're my employees.

Bluey, Pup, and Dingo are recovering after the local community rallied behind the family to pay thousands of dollars in vet bills to help treat them.

Dr Kruger said the dogs were healthy one day, then very sick the next. ""Most likely, we can't confirm, most likely they probably ingested something that's been poisoned that damaged the gastro intestinal tract, the lining,"" she said. ""That's why they were throwing up so much. We found blood in the faeces, that means the lining in the gut is damaged. ""It's hard to say what it was but it was something that was very, very strong."" The RSPCA is investigating to find out exactly what happened. South West inspector Genna Haines said attacks on pets were common and widespread across WA. ""It's awful, it's very sad that animals are being targeted in these kinds of deliberate attacks,"" she said. ""Predominantly it's more in suburban areas, and it's usually because of neighbour disputes or disputes between people. ""Unfortunately the animals get caught in the middle and they get targeted. ""In a lot of cases it is fatal, so getting your dog to the vet as soon as possible can make a huge difference as to whether they survive or not.""

ts74,"It's been six years since a permanent doctor has walked the wards of Clermont Hospital. It's a familiar story in country towns across Australia, but this central Queensland town had has a happy ending with the recent arrival of a new GP. Tim Lane was raised on a property outside Dalby in south-east Queensland. He was a latecomer to the medical field, beginning his studies at 31 years old. After completing his training in the city, it was life in the country that called him to the small town of Clermont, 380 kilometres north-west of Rockhampton. ""I went and became a rural GP because my family and I like small country towns,"" he said. ""I've worked in the city as a GP, and you can get the same thing over and over again."" Dr Lane relocated with his 13-month-old son Dominic and partner, Fred. ""The community have been ultra welcoming, and everyone knew who we were when walking down the street and were introducing themselves,"" he said. For years, the town of 3,000 people has rallied together with the Mackay Hospital and Health Service (MHHS) to attract medical professionals to Clermont, and in Dr Lane's case, succeeded. In 2022, Clermont had a sole GP based at the private clinic but today have two, alongside Dr Lane at the hospital. He said the lack of understanding and incentives were major factors in the struggle to get doctors to go bush. ""You've got most GPs wanting a family-orientated lifestyle and they think schooling in the big cities is better,"" Dr Lane said. ""You get the same rebates from Medicare whether you are city or rural, so it's hard to privately bill. ""Whereas in the city, if you want to privately bill you can charge them $100 a visit with no concerns because you've got enough people to fill your books."" To recruit more doctors, Dr Lane said the MHHS would provide upskilling services, which he hoped would also help create a structured on-call roster. ""They can identify gaps and then organise with Mackay or Proserpine to go in and provide training on a monthly basis,"" he said. There are also gaps in services he hoped they would be able to improve, such as attracting specialists on a visiting rotation. Director of Nursing Jan Faulconbridge said relying on locums to treat up to 25 patients a day had been tough. ""There's no continuity of care. They would come for two weeks, there'd be a different person, and you never knew the skill set of the people who were coming,"" she said. ""This puts a huge workload on our nurses to advocate for patients."" Ms Faulconbridge said there had been extended periods of time when no locums were available, so the nurses relied on the Telehealth Emergency Management Support Unit (TEMSUE). TEMSUE allows doctors to virtually assess patients and prescribe medication, but she said it was far more beneficial to have an in-person doctor. ""Dr Lane is very good. It's very nice to have someone finally so that we've got continuity for our elderly and all of our quality assurance throughout the hospital,"" she said. ""He's lovely and very easy to communicate with, so I think we'll keep him around.""

ts75,"On his sprawling cattle property in central Queensland, grazier Frank Finger is mustering cattle with his trusty team of working dogs. Among his black and tan kelpies, a fluffy white border collie with mismatched eyes stands out. ""I called him Lucky because I was lucky to have him,"" Frank says. ""And he was probably lucky to be here because I put up an effort to make something of him. ""I just knew that I'd win him over by friendship."" From the original 10-puppy litter from season two of Muster Dogs, breeder Mick Hudson soon discovered that Lucky was deaf when he wouldn't budge as Mick approached his kennel. ""All the pups would wake up and this bloke would stay asleep,"" Mick says. Lucky was considered a pup who would only make it as a family pet, but his herding instincts shone on arrival at Frank's property near Clermont. With some tender care, he's now mustering cattle despite his differences. ""He's a very friendly dog, a happy dog and I think he wants to please me,"" Frank says. Deafness and hearing loss are common health issues for dogs, according to Susan Sommerlad, a veterinarian who specialises in canine audiology. Susan says dogs being deaf from birth is common in more than 100 breeds, including border collies, Australian shepherds, bull terriers, cocker spaniels, and labradors, with genetics being an important factor. She says dogs are more likely to be born deaf if they have blue or multicoloured eyes or if they have mostly white coats. Frank is an expert dog handler and the season one winner of Muster Dogs. Before Lucky arrived, he'd never trained a dog that was deaf. ""I thought some of them couldn't [hear] in the early days, but that was just that they were ignoring me,"" Frank says. Frank says that learning how to catch the collie's attention and developing a strong bond have both been key in Lucky's training. Frank says teaching Lucky how to muster has been similar to training his kelpies because of their natural herding instinct. But here's what Frank does differently with Lucky: Frank says the biggest challenge is getting Lucky's attention, as he can't call him off if Lucky's chasing cattle he shouldn't be or if he's in the wrong place. ""You've got to do it without any verbal command — he doesn't know his name or anything,"" Frank says. ""He's just running off body language, and that's what dogs do most – we'd be better off if we did that all the time rather than roaring at them."" Frank says he can also get Lucky to recall by calling to his other dogs. As they look at Frank, it helps prompt Lucky to look at him too, which Frank then follows with a clap so Lucky will come. Bec Collyer is a behaviour and training expert with RSPCA Queensland where she guides animal shelters on how to best train dogs and cats. Bec says markers are essential for training all dogs as they signal a reward is coming. For example, a marker is used when a hearing dog is rewarded with a verbal ""yes"" or ""good dog"" for the right behaviour and then is given a treat. ""Dogs only have three seconds to associate the behaviour they just performed to the reward they're getting,"" Bec says. ""The marker gives the owner, or the handler, a little bit more time to capture the behaviour they're seeing and be able to reward it."" For dogs that are hard of hearing or deaf, like Lucky, Bec finds these tips helpful: For dogs that are blind or have low vision, Bec recommends: Bec says training can be modified to suit any dog, regardless of its ability. ""There's so many amazing stories about blind and deaf dogs who have gotten really far in agility and even detection work,"" she said. ""Every dog is different ... it's really down to the individual at the end of the day."" Meanwhile, Lucky is living his best life on Frank's farm with his new siblings Luce and Annie from season one of Muster Dogs. Frank says the kelpies are getting along well with the snowy-haired pup as he happily learns the ropes as a pedigree sheepdog and that he has fitted straight into the pack. ""They've got used to seeing him now. They don't worry at all,"" he says. ""It's not a problem working collies with kelpies because the herding instinct is exactly the same.""

ts76,"In a small coastal town popular with foodies and sea-changers, locals are grappling with a tall question that could change the character of their growing hamlet: how high is too high? The local council is in the final stages of considering proposals for three 5-storey apartment buildings on a block of land in the heart of Merimbula, on the New South Wales South Coast.  It is also examining a proposal to build a 7-storey, 100-room hotel and conference facility in the town.  Similar applications in Merimbula have been rejected in recent years after a backlash from a community that's used to single-storey blocks with big backyards, and one that has so far been left ""untouched"" by big development. It's a similar story in other towns, as the pandemic-induced sea-change — led in many places by young professionals — is causing growing pains all over the country. Some towns are seeing rough sleepers on their streets for the first time. Across regional Australia, populations have increased by an average of 12 per cent on pre-COVID levels, and they're squeezing an already tight housing market. Median house prices have risen by a ""staggering"" 54 per cent in three years, according to the Regional Australia Institute (RAI), and the rental vacancy rate is at a near-record low of 1.2 per cent. In Merimbula — a six-hour drive south of Sydney — the median house price has surged to $1,025,000, according to local real estate agents. Rental properties, listed for about $600 a week, are being snapped up as soon as they're advertised. It's why the Bega Valley Shire Council is giving serious thought to raising the building height limit in the town to accommodate new developments that could help to alleviate the region's housing shortage. Analysis by the RAI has found apartments make up just 2 to 3 per cent of the total housing stock in some regional markets, compared to more than 42 per cent in metro areas. Master Builders Association chief executive Denita Wawn said with so many younger Australians moving away from capital cities, regional towns needed to have a conversation about embracing ""medium density and small high-rise"" developments. ""If we're getting young professionals coming into these centres, they don't want a detached house with a large garden,"" she told the RAI's recent housing summit. ""It's an important conversation about going up."" In the heart of western NSW, that conversation is well underway. Dubbo's council has approved its first high-rise development — three apartment blocks, of up to 15-storeys. While such a development is unusual for a big, inland city, many of the 80 units have been sold off the plan, demonstrating the level of demand for  accommodation in the community. After the urbanisation of the 1950s, RAI chief executive officer Liz Ritchie believes the pendulum is swinging back the other way, as mainly millennial city-dwellers search for a more affordable lifestyle. ""We're facing a societal shift,"" Ms Ritchie told the summit. ""Five years ago, there were plenty of houses in regional Australia and here we are today in a very constrained market."" She says the ""staggering"" increase in house prices has had a flow-on effect, pushing locals out of the property market and into tents, cars, caravans and temporary accommodation. Most regional councils are contending with rough sleepers for the first time, according to Australian Local Government Association head Linda Scott, who described it as a ""dramatic change"" in a short period of time.  ""There are very few places in Australia that don't speak to me about either having rough sleepers in their towns and villages for the first time — or in recent memory — or knowing that there are families and people on the precipice of rough sleeping on their towns and cities,"" Ms Scott said. The Member for the Victorian seat of Indi, Helen Haines, put it bluntly: ""We have run out of places for people to live. ""For decades successive governments have said, 'Build it and they will come'.  ""Well, they've come, and we haven't built it."" Depending on who you talk to, the reasons for this housing crisis are obvious: developers accuse councils of taking too long to consider development applications and, in turn, councils often blame restrictive state government planning rules. And that's before you consider the fact that construction costs have risen by 40 per cent on pre-COVID levels, according to the Master Builders Association. As his council considers whether ""small"" high-rise is the answer in Merimbula, Bega Valley Shire Mayor Russell Fitzpatrick insists the local government is trying to address the region's housing shortage. He points to a council proposal that's been sitting on the NSW Planning Department's desk since December 2022 for a 300-lot subdivision in the small village of Wolumla – about 15 kilometres west of Merimbula. ""We've got a fair bit of land available but it's horrendous trying to get blocks of land released,"" he said, blaming a mix of community pushback, biodiversity laws and state planning rules. ""I believe in good planning but it's bureaucracy gone mad sometimes,"" he said. While the reasons for the housing shortage are many and varied, all experts agree that the answer is more supply. To that end, the RAI is demanding the federal government help solve the problem by allocating 40 per cent of its Housing Australia Future Fund (HAFF) to the regions, to boost supplies of social and affordable housing. ""If we look at the 1.2 million homes to be built in the next five years, we need around 450,000 of those located in the right places in regional Australia,"" Ms Ritchie said. ""While it is still more affordable to buy in the regions, for now, there is no third option if locals or metro-movers are priced out of the market, and supply fails to meet demand.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-13/housing-shortage-forcing-small-towns-to-consider-high-rise/103455916
ts77,"After more than a month at sea, thousands of animals on board a live export ship off Western Australia's coast are set to be allowed back on land during the coming week. The MV Bahijah arrived off Australia's coast almost two weeks ago, but has been stuck without a plan since then. It's a situation that has been criticised by animal welfare groups and farming lobbies. The MV Bahijah left Fremantle Port for Jordan, in the Middle East, on January 5. It was destined to travel through the Red Sea, a crucial shipping route that has been the target of missile and drone attacks from Yemen's Houthi rebels. Seven days into the ship's voyage, the exporter — Israel-based Bassem Dabbah — decided the Red Sea was too risky, and swerved onto a route all the way around Africa. The long detour meant the ship needed to restock on fodder, medicine, and other supplies. The exporter offered alternative contingency plans to get supplies from elsewhere. The Department of Agriculture rejected the plan and instead ordered the ship to return to Australia on January 19. ""There was insufficient information to enable the department to issue approvals for alternative contingency markets, especially given the risks the delegate identified in respect of the nature and timing of the route,"" a department spokesperson said. The exporter applied to deploy on a 60-day voyage after restocking in Australia, but this was also rejected by the department.  The exporter went back to the drawing board and applied again, but this time it would take much longer for them to get an answer. Meanwhile, MV Bahijah and its thousands of passengers arrived off the coast of Fremantle, south of Perth, on January 29. Stuck off the coast with no plan, there was an uproar from the public about issues ranging from animal welfare, to allegations of incompetence from the industry. ""These sheep and cattle would have been standing in their own waste for the last 24 days,"" RSPCA chief scientist Suzanne Fowler said at the time. The department sent two independent veterinarians on board the ship on January 31. They found the ""livestock appeared in very good condition"". However, they also noted concerns about having the animals standing in their own waste for such a long period. ""Our only welfare concern would be possible impending issues should cattle pens in particular not be able to [be] washed in the coming days,"" they wrote in their report. Israeli animal welfare groups started to file legal proceedings to stop another voyage. The groups Let the Animals Live and Animals Now filed for an injunction in Israel that could have prevented an import permit from being issued for MV Bahijah. Those legal proceedings would delay any decisions from the department about the fate of the Bahijah, out of fear the ship would not be allowed into Israel. There was a flurry of correspondence for days between the exporter, the department, and Israeli authorities. Finally, on February 5 — a week after the ship arrived off WA's coast — the department denied the Bahijah's redeployment. In the department's statement of reasons, acting first assistant secretary Andrew McDonald said he couldn't risk the ship being deployed to Israel, only to be stuck outside another port with no plan. ""The risk that the Israeli competent authority may not be able to grant the import permits or otherwise accept the livestock upon arrival, outweighed the detailed mitigation strategies that had been identified,"" Mr McDonald wrote. He said it was regrettable the whirlwind of information and developments meant he couldn't make a decision earlier. Finally, WA's Premier Roger Cook on Sunday flagged the ship would be destocked during the next week or so. But Mr Cook would not comment on whether the livestock would be processed in the state.

ts78,"Being in charge of Hewitt, the largest organic meat company in Australia and the world's largest organic cattle station, Mick and Ben Hewitt often do business in boardrooms and high-rise buildings around the world. But watching the pair saddle up horses and joke with young stockmen and women, it is clear the brothers are truly content in the dust and dirt of central Australia. Self-confessed wild bush kids, the Hewitt boys grew up in central Queensland with big dreams which they have worked together to turn into reality. They now oversee 2.2 million hectares of land across the nation, from sheep and cattle stations to piggeries, running 200,000 head of livestock across more than 20 major aggregations. Ben, who is Hewitt's agribusiness chief executive, said they didn't necessarily set out to be the biggest or the boldest. ""It was just to buy the right assets and then let the journey take itself along,"" he said. The Hewitt empire stretches from the Red Centre to Julia Creek, and to the western districts of Victoria. It includes the largest organically-certified land parcel in the world — four properties named Narwietooma, Glen Helen, Derwent, and Napperby, which are all in the Northern Territory. Parents Colin and Linda handed the Hewitt company to their sons in 2014, at which point the ambitious brothers really began to spread their wings. Mick, who is Hewitt group chief executive and managing director, said he and his brother worked on large cattle stations and saw what scale delivered in terms of opportunity. ""That kind of got the creative cogs churning and then it was a case of actually how to get about doing that,"" Mick said. The brothers decided borrowing from banks was not a model they wanted to pursue. ""The traditional debt-funded family model didn't seem to be really the root,"" Mick said. ""It was somewhat limiting, and so then we started to just think a bit bigger."" They started searching for strategic partners to invest, and an answer came in 2015 in the form of a Canadian handshake. Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board was looking to partner up and invest in agriculture. It managed the superannuation of Canadian government workers, including the mounted police and armed services. ""It certainly wasn't luck of the draw or we certainly didn't get stumbled across,"" Ben said. ""It was quite a concerted effort to find someone who would partner with us and provide the strategic support, I suppose, and the financial support for us to be able to take advantage of those opportunities that we could see."" The move also set an important precedent in Australia. ""We were one of the first, if not the first, platform that established that way in Australia, really that private and institutional wealth partnering,"" Mick said. ""We're hopeful that one of our legacies will be that we paved the way for other families to explore that and maximise that type of investment structure."" The Canadian group has gone on to spend $4 billion on agricultural assets globally and is now one of the largest farm landowners and investors in Australian agriculture. The Hewitts rejected criticism of foreign land ownership and say capital diversity is critical. ""There's all manner of ways to raise capital to grow a business,"" Mick said. ""It's naive to suggest anything other, and so I don't really focus on where the capital came from. ""I focus on what the capital contributes to my communities I work within, to our overall economy and to the people who work in our business. ""That is what capital should do, capital of whatever form — provided it comes from high-integrity sources — should be able to deliver great prosperity to communities across Australia."" Mick said it was a space that needed to transition from a cottage industry to a legitimate one. ""Having the scale or the emerging scale that we had … I just really identified it as something that was worthwhile pursuing,"" he said.  Love of the outback lifestyle is shared right throughout the company, from managers to those out mustering cattle, such as Narwietooma station hand Amber Smith. She said she loved working in the different landscapes. Meanwhile, assistant station manager Ed Gibson said he enjoyed seeing the animals happy and healthy. ""You have those little moments where you are really proud of what you do and who you do it with,"" he said. Mick said his dream was to create an iconic business that contributed to rural communities as well as the broader economy. ""I want to have impact and I want to have impact that can actually be seen around the world, not just here in Australia,"" he said.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2024-02-10/hewitt-brothers-largest-organically-certified-land-parcel/103405646
ts79,"After seven months of silence, the bellows of cattle and the calls of auctioneers are once again echoing around one of the largest livestock facilities in New South Wales.  The Northern Rivers Livestock Exchange (NRLX) in Casino was closed last year due to a stand-off between agents and its owner Richmond Valley Council. NRLX has now reopened in time for the upcoming weaner season, with tens of thousands of extra cattle needing to be sold by local producers. George and Furhmann managing director Darren Perkins said they had no regrets standing their ground over selling agreements. ""This is a very, very good facility, and it was a shame that it was closed for so long,"" he said. ""Lismore was a very good operational centre for us. ""At the end of the day, we've come in through all the negotiations [and] we're back here at the Casino saleyards."" All five agents previously working from the facility returned to the saleyard today for their first combined prime cattle sale, with 2,300 head on offer. The facility is now being run by Outcross Agri-Services, under a five-year lease. Speaking for the first time since the takeover, managing director Tom Newsome said the transition had been ""incredibly smooth"". He revealed the agents' yard fees would change from $1 per head sold to 0.2 per cent on agents' gross revenue, and that producers' fees had increased by five per cent. ""When you consider inflation, it's actually it's not keeping up with inflation, so there's no significant difference from a vendor's perspective,"" he said. The new operator has also introduced pre-sale pen scanning, with a $1.18 fee to be charged per animal. Mr Newsome said industry was consulted on those changes and going forward an advisory committee will be formed with major stakeholders. ""That will mean each group — vendors, buyers, transporters, agents, people with a commercial interest in what goes on here, will have a forum so they can provide advice and put forward their point of view,"" he said. Urbenville livestock carrier Travis Phelps welcomed the move back to Casino. ""The extra cartage, especially for where we are, definitely wasn't ideal,"" he said. ""Producers having to have cattle off the property earlier so that we had enough time to get the cattle down to the saleyards in Lismore, definitely put a lot more stress on everyone. ""Obviously the cost did hit us a little bit — we had to then pass that on to the producer, which obviously adds up for them too because it cost them more and at that time, prices on cattle weren't overly great, so the producer was feeling it a lot as well."" Robert Gill from Alexander Downs at Merriwa travelled 800 kilometres to attend the first sale back in Casino. ""We buy a number of cattle out here each week and they're good cattle and and we'd like to support this area,"" he said. ""We've got a wholesale meat abattoir that we supply, so we feed them for 70 or 80 days and they're into the local trade. ""We [also] supply Woolworths with 200 cattle a week, which we've been supplying for 39 years."" While the NRLX gates have reopened, the Lismore Saleyards will remain an important selling facility for many local producers like Peter Hannigan from Numulgi. But he was happy with the prices paid for the 160 head he sold at the first sale back in Casino. ""It's got to be good for everybody getting back over there, the place can handle numbers, [and it] makes life a bit easier for the agents,"" he said. ""For me it doesn't make much difference, but I think it's good for the town there.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-07/northern-rivers-livestock-exchange-casino-reopens-cattle-auction/103431352
ts80,"Farmers are worried about the viability of their businesses and some have been forced to diversify to keep up with the cost. For the first time, cattle farmer Daniel Perry has resorted to growing a grain crop on his central Queensland property in a bid to keep up with the skyrocketing cost of his rural rates bill. Mr Perry said he made the decision to plant after his rates rose by more than 66 per cent in three years.  He is worried his annual bill of $30,000 will increase again after the valuer-general issues fresh land valuations on March 31. ""It's big bickies for us. It's a lot of money to find for a small family business each year,"" Mr Perry said. ""It's all pointed me towards diversifying because I can't carry more cattle. ""The council rates are basically determining the land use, so I'm out there ploughing out grass and trying to grow grain to try to get more money out of that soil."" Mr Perry's 4,850-hectare property is near Emerald and falls under the Central Highlands Regional Council's local government area. In 2021, his annual rates bill was $18,000 a year, compared with $30,000 a year now. He said unless the rate rises slowed down, his business could become unviable in 10 years. ""We run on a shoestring, really. Our running costs are sort of $120,000 to $150,000, and $30,000 of that is council rates,"" Mr Perry said. ""It's by far the biggest overhead expense or burden on the business."" Rates in Queensland are determined by how much revenue councils need to raise, alongside the value of a property. There have been calls in recent years to change how council rates are calculated for farmers to limit higher rate costs.  When land valuations increase significantly, there are options available to limit the rates increases. For the past three years, the Central Highlands Regional Council has used a rates capping method, which for 2023–24 was 10 per cent. It means irrespective of any rise in valuation the rates can only increase by a maximum of 10 per cent compared with 30 per cent the previous year. ""We take all concerns … into consideration,"" council acting chief executive Ross Higgins said. AgForce central Queensland president John Baker said ongoing large rate hikes were unsustainable in the long term. ""There are some people who are missing out on the capping, and some of it is to do with property amalgamations or succession planning, those sorts of things,"" Mr Baker said. ""They're being faced with the full increase in their rates … some of them are getting up to a level that is pretty hard to sustain."" Mr Perry said that as he did not want to sell his property and planned to pass his land down to his two young sons, aged 10 and 12, there was no benefit to a higher land value. ""I'll never see any of that money. That valuation money is nothing, something that you'll never see if it goes to plan,"" he said. ""That's what's driving me the most is my kids. It's my job to try and preserve it for them, just like my dad did for me."" Mr Higgins said the council would be considering all options ahead of its 2024–25 annual budget. He said the council had committed to engaging with the community, and hosted four community information sessions in January, with about 140 residents attending, the majority of whom were rural ratepayers. ""We found the feedback and the discussions from those sessions were quite productive and will certainly be taking those into consideration in the next budget preparation,"" Mr Higgins said. Mr Perry said he did not receive a bin service and accessed his property via an unsealed road, which was occasionally graded by the council. He urged the council to go back to basics. ""Just keep the lights on, keep the water flowing, the sewerage under control … and then control costs like I'm sure every business does,"" Mr Perry said.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-07/rural-rates-central-highlands-landowners-business-valuations/103433206
ts81,"We're still technically in an El Niño period and already the first weather agency has put the world on watch for La Niña. The United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has announced it is officially on La Niña watch and stated that the current El Niño is weakening and likely to end this autumn. The last ""triple dip"" La Niña in Australia — between 2020 and 2022 — contributed to billions of dollars in damage from flooding and extreme rain across much of eastern Australia. For Australians already grappling with a summer that has defied expectations, the news we could face La Niña again so soon may spark fears about the year ahead. But before you freak out, it's important to understand what goes into these predictions, and why Australian climate scientists are still monitoring the situation before any local warnings are sounded. La Niña, El Niño and their lesser-known cousin, ""neutral"", are the phases of a natural climate cycle that affects weather around the world, especially in Australia. They're known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. In Australia, La Niña is traditionally associated with cooler, wetter weather, whereas El Niño usually brings drier and hotter conditions. La Niña occurs when the equatorial trade winds across the Pacific Ocean become stronger, changing the ocean's surface currents and drawing cooler deep water up from below, resulting in warmer ocean surface temperatures near Australia. At the moment, we're still in an El Niño phase, although the drivers that underpin it are weakening. On Thursday US weather agency NOAA rated the chances of the current El Niño ending and neutral phase returning in the Australian autumn at 79 per cent. They're good odds. But when it comes to the chances of a return to La Niña in winter, it put the chances at 55 per cent. Kim Reid, a climate scientist at Monash University's Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, says those chances of a La Niña are ""a coin toss"". ""All of these weather and climate forecasts, they're all about probability. They tell you which is most likely,"" Dr Reid said. ""As people hopefully know, the favourite horse doesn't always win the race. Even if something has a slightly higher than 50 per cent chance of occurring, that doesn't necessarily mean it will occur."" The NOAA is a respected agency when it comes to weather and climate forecasting. However, it does emphasise different indicators when looking at the chances of a coming La Niña compared to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). Both La Niña and El Niño are caused by what's happening in the oceans and also in the atmosphere. In Australia, the BOM's criteria reflect this. ""For a stage to be reached, Bureau of Meteorology climatologists assess whether a set of atmospheric and oceanic criteria have been met, and that the current state of the climate system has reached that status level,"" the BOM says. In contrast, the NOAA only requires that certain conditions in the oceans be met before it is on ""watch"" for a looming La Niña. That is because the extreme weather impacts these phases have on the US — especially hurricanes — are driven more by changes in the ocean. ""In general, meteorological agencies have tailored their services around the impact of La Niña/El Niño for their country, and the bureau considers its service best suited for Australia,"" a BOM spokesman told the ABC. The BOM also has a higher threshold for sea surface temperature differences that need to be observed to trigger a La Niña ""watch"" stage. That was the same situation last year when the BOM made a noticeably different prediction in May for the chances of an El Niño– 50 per cent compared to NOAA's 90 per cent – and waited until later to declare that an El Niño event was underway. However, when it comes to declaring a La Niña event is underway (unlike just watching for one), the BOM says the two agencies' differences are narrower. ""Differences between agency evaluations of a La Niña or El Niño event are most apparent during the developing phase of an event, or when an event is relatively weak,"" a BOM spokesman said. Dr Reid says long-term weather forecasting is less precise at this time of year. ""We tend to have strong relationships between these climate drivers like El Niño/La Niña and Australia's weather in winter and spring,"" she explained. ""Whereas in summer and autumn, there are a lot more ups and down extremes in the weather. It's this well-known predictability barrier, and that the models just aren't as accurate in autumn."" The BOM says a La Niña phase has developed about 40–50 per cent of the time after an El Niño phase. Even if La Niña returns later this year, there is no guarantee we will see extreme weather events and natural disasters like those during the last triple La Niña. La Niña wasn't the only climate driver that caused the widespread flooding and high rainfall at that time. There was also what's known as a negative Indian Ocean dipole, which is similar to La Niña but for the Indian Ocean, and a positive southern annular mode, which all combined to cause extreme weather and flooding. ""I'm hoping people don't freak out at the prospect of a La Niña yet because it's not the only thing that affects Australia's weather,"" Dr Reid said. Adding heat to this complex system, like we're doing on a global scale, is making the job of climate forecasting more complicated. For example, La Niña phases have traditionally been associated with cooler global temperatures, but the last three were still hotter than historical El Niño years. The burning of fossil fuels has put more heat into the atmosphere as well as the ocean, with oceans absorbing up to 90 per cent of warming so far. Currently, global sea surface temperatures are still at a record high, although NOAA's La Niña watch has observed the water cooling deeper in the ocean. Dr Reid says the warming oceans are affecting how these natural weather events play out, such as this summer's cooler-than-usual El Niño. ""Normally with an El Niño, we have cool ocean temperatures near Australia, and that's why we get suppressed rain,"" she said. ""But because of climate change and the ocean just being warm everywhere, the ocean pattern wasn't what we normally expect. ""We're basing this off our historical observations, what we've seen in the past, but what we're seeing now we haven't seen before. So we're venturing into uncharted territory."" With so much focus on ocean temperatures when monitoring for these weather patterns, there's a discussion in climate science circles about whether the baselines need to be adjusted to account for warming temperatures. ""Historically, we used to associate La Niña with much cooler, below-average global temperatures,"" Dr Reid said. But we're at the point with global warming where a La Niña year is hotter than, say, an El Niño year 30 years ago.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-12/la-nina-watch-called-in-us-but-bom-cautious/103446528
ts82,"Across the east coast, temperatures have been described by the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) as ""oppressive"" this summer. The dew point in some parts of south-east Queensland has tipped to 26 degrees Celsius, exceeding that of equatorial countries like Singapore. To put that into context, when a dew point temperature exceeds 24C that's when it can feel uncomfortable and lead to heat stress, according to BOM. Simply put, no. The dew point is the temperature where the air must be cooled to form condensation — or dew. If you take the recent dew point and actual temperatures in Brisbane as an example, on Saturday the temperature reached a top of 34.9C with a dew point of 26C. So if you were to hold an object in the air that was 26C on Saturday, that object would have condensation on it. ""The dew point dictates the 'feels like' temperature and the level of discomfort for people, so the higher the dew point the more moisture there is in the air,"" senior meteorologist Felim Hanniffy said.  Essentially when you're soaked in sweat every time you leave the house, that's because of the dew point. Humidity, on the other hand, is the percentage of how close the air is to total saturation of moisture.  The higher the humidity, the higher the chance of rain as the water vapour condenses. ""So while you could have a temperature of 10C, and a dew point of 8C — which gives you 80 per cent humidity — that would feel a lot different to a temperature of 30C with 80 per cent humidity,"" Mr Hanniffy said. Obviously, a colder day will feel different to a warmer day — even when the humidity is the same in both cases — and that's why the dew point is more relevant on hot days. For this reason, humidity is not a suitable guide on how much moisture is present, due to its relationship to temperature.  The humid conditions across the east have been driven by the warm ocean temperatures. Steven Sherwood from the Climate Change Research Centre for UNSW said the concern is the possibility of more humid days in the future. ""The dew point has been quite high and there's been a lot of humidity, so that's likely to continue as the oceans remain warm,"" Professor Sherwood said. ""Most of the world's oceans right now have been above the old average of temperatures and that's due to global warming."" Unfortunately, feeling hot and bothered looks likely to continue for the summer. For south-east Queenslanders, a tropical air mass is what's keeping the state uncomfortable, according to BOM. ""The air mass is a combination of the ex-Tropical Cyclone Kirrily moving slowly over the north-west, and a slow-moving trough over the south-east,"" Mr Hanniffy said. Despite being separate systems, they're both ""helping draw down the equatorial air mass across eastern Queensland and producing these pre-wet season conditions"". A slight reprieve is expected from Wednesday as the trough contracts north but, with warm ocean temperatures surrounding the east coast, more humid days are expected. The problem with humidity and ""feels like"" temperatures is that they don't take into account exercise. ""To keep cool in hot weather, you have to perspire and that perspiration has to evaporate which is what cools you off"" Professor Sherwood said.  With high humidity, the process of cooling off becomes difficult and that's where the feels like temperature can be unhelpful for some. ""The feels like temperature doesn't incorporate the effects of humidity because it's designed to express how the temperature feels when you're not exercising,"" he said. ""There are points that our body can't cope with the heat, and so for anyone at risk of heat stress that risk becomes higher when it's humid"".",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-30/qld-dew-point-heatwave-rain-weather-humidity-bom/103400626
ts83,"Queensland's newest cyclone remains in its adolescence, still not yet fully formed and swirling off the coast as a tropical low.  It is expected to bring significant rainfall totals to parts of Queensland. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) expects the system to develop into Tropical Cyclone Kirrily sometime on Wednesday. For now, it has slowed its march towards the mainland, stalling slightly in the northern Coral Sea. It's currently forecast to hit the coast late on Thursday night and into Friday morning. In the days following, it is expected to revert to a tropical low, dumping heavy rain. With so many catchments across the state already saturated, there is a risk of flash flooding. Dr Annie Lau from the University of Queensland's School of Environment said the term tropical low — or tropical depression in the US — refers to a low-pressure system similar to a tropical cyclone, but of lower intensity. ""A tropical depression has to get low pressure to form — a lot of humidity in the atmosphere and also high temperatures,"" Dr Lau said. ""We call it a moderate strength, low-pressure system. It's often associated with monsoon troughs and is something that we see a lot in the tropics. ""Not every depression will develop into a cyclone. The atmospheric conditions have to be really favourable."" BOM senior forecaster Felim Hanniffy said a tropical low is upgraded when its winds reach a certain speed. ""Once a system has wind speeds of more than gale force — that's winds in excess of 65 kilometres an hour — and is more than halfway around the system's low-pressure centre, then it becomes a named system."" He said tropical lows needed very warm sea temperatures to form, along with lots of moisture in the air. ""Sea temperatures above 26.5 degrees are usually considered the threshold to sustain these systems, as they derive all their energy from that interaction."" Dr Lau said the risk of heavy falls increases the longer a tropical low remains stalled over the Coral Sea. ""The more time the cyclone stays offshore to gather moisture, the more rainfall it will bring to the inland and the coastal area. ""The other thing is for a slower-moving cyclone, which has a slower forward speed, it doesn't push that much water to the coast, so the storm surge risk would be slightly lower."" Mr Hanniffy said slower cyclones often affect inland areas more than coastal areas. ""Once they come inland they slow more, which means they can sit over an area for an extended period of time and dump vast amounts of rainfall,"" he said. A a tropical low could move inland for ""several days well after the initial landfall"", Mr Hanniffy said. ""And that just spreads heavy rainfall risk across a very wide area, and obviously increases the risk of some widespread flooding as well,"" he said. ""Localised daily falls of 200 to 300 millimetres, if not more for a couple of days, wouldn't be out of the question."" The tropical low from ex-Tropical Cyclone Jasper that remained stalled over Cairns and surrounds brought record-breaking rainfall totals to Far North Queensland, causing severe flooding. The Daintree River rose to 14.85 metres, smashing the previous record of 12.6m, while the Barron River reached 4.4m, breaking the 1977 record of 3.8m. South-east Queensland was hit by devastating storms through December and into the New Year period, with many weather stations recording 300 millimetres or more already this month. Mr Hanniffy said the ground in those areas would not absorb heavy falls. ""We've seen persistent shower and thunderstorm activity and a lot of catchments have moistened,"" he said. ""When you get a slow-moving tropical cyclone, there's a significant risk of widespread flooding."" Tropical Cyclone Debbie battered the Queensland coast in March 2017, making landfall in the Whitsunday Islands and Airlie Beach, devastating the region. As the system lost power, it became a tropical low and made its way down the coast, bringing damaging winds and torrential rainfall to central and south-east Queensland. Falls of almost 1 metre were recorded west of Mackay in two days, while the Gold Coast Hinterland received more than 600mm of rain in one day. Mr Hanniffy said the current tropical low bears some similarities to Debbie. ""Cyclone Debbie made landfall as category four, it was probably closer to the coast and moved inland and then moved south along the east coast,"" he said. ""This system probably looks like going further inland and is likely to be a weaker system even by the time it makes the coast, but we are looking at several days with this system lingering inland.""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-23/tropical-cyclone-kirrily-heavy-rain-flood-risk-queensland-bom/103379514
ts84,"Six large and ""optionally crewed"" naval vessels heavily armed with missiles will be added to Australia's surface fleet under a dramatic $11 billion reshaping of the navy that will also see the acquisition of 11 new general-purpose frigates to be partly built overseas. Labor has unveiled its long-awaited ""Enhanced Lethality Surface Combatant Fleet"", which will include six Hunter-class frigates, reduced from an original plan of nine, as well as upgraded versions of the existing Hobart-class destroyers fitted with Tomahawk cruise missiles. Under the sweeping overhaul, Australia's current fleet of combat-ready warships would rise from 11 to 26, consisting of nine ""Tier 1"" frigates and destroyers and 11 smaller general-purpose frigates, as well as six optionally crewed vessels which will form a ""Tier 2"" force. Defence Minister Richard Marles said that, while the optionally crewed vessels had ""the capacity to operate in an uncrewed fashion"", Australia's intention was to use crews. Australia's oldest currently serving warship, HMAS Anzac, will be immediately retired ahead of the gradual replacement of the aging Anzac-class fleet with new frigates which will first be built in either Germany, Korea, Japan or Spain. The planned number of Offshore Patrol Vessels being built in Western Australia will be halved to six and will eventually form part of a planned fleet of 25 minor war vessels dominated by Evolved Cape Class patrol boats. The government will consider the eventual replacement for the Hobart-class destroyers ""in the context of the 2026 National Defence Strategy"" to align with a continuous naval shipbuilding strategy at Adelaide's Osborne Naval shipyard. Releasing the plan at Sydney's Garden Island Naval base, Mr Marles insisted the plan was ""fully funded"" and would inject an additional $1.7 billion over the forward estimates and $11.1 billion over the next decade into defence. ""The enhanced lethality surface combatant fleet will ensure the navy is optimised for operations in our current and future environment, underpinned by the meticulous assessment conducted by the Independent Analysis Team,"" Mr Marles said. ""This significant advancement in navy capability that will be delivered under this plan requires a strong, sovereign defence industry,"" Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy added. The Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Mark Hammond, called it ""a serious investment and a serious challenge for our navy to step up and deliver"". ""This is a real shot in the arm in terms of understanding the important role that the Australian navy sailors play across the Indo-Pacific,"" he said. ""This will be the largest surface combatant force we've operated in generations. It will also be, in time, the most lethal."" Coalition defence spokesman Andrew Hastie accused Mr Marles of weakness for failing to deliver enough short-term extra funding. ""The truth is that Richard Marles went to cabinet and lost to Jim Chalmers, Penny Wong and Katy Gallagher. He couldn't secure any more money,"" he said.

ts85,"About 100 people in Australia are struck by lightning each year. Experts say up to 90 per cent of them go on to lead a normal, healthy life after being discharged from hospital. But lightning strikes can also be fatal, with millions of volts of electricity coursing through the body and sending the heart into cardiac arrest. As four victims of a lightning strike yesterday remain in hospital in Sydney, the State Emergency Service (SES) is reiterating warnings to stay inside during a storm. Here's what happens when a person is struck by lightning and how you can stay safe in a storm. The people struck by lightning in Sydney's Botanic Gardens had been sheltering under a tree when they were struck. Patrick Murch from the SES said under a tree was one of the worst places to be during a storm. ""A significant number of injuries do result from people being on or near trees during lightning storms because that ground around the tree becomes electrified,"" he said. ""[As] the lightning moves through that object it will spread out across the ground. ""Water is a great conductor so if it is wet on the ground, it can potentially spread further than you're anticipating."" He said trees attracted lightning because it sought the quickest pathway to the ground. The SES recommend people seek shelter indoors during a storm. or make themselves low to the ground if that is not possible. ""Try to get yourself off any hills or any high points in the area that you're in because again, the lightning will potentially try and find something else that's a little bit higher than you,"" Mr Murch said. Cars are also a good option. ""Cars are designed to ground the vehicle so as long as you're inside the vehicle, generally you won't see negative effects on you as a person,"" Mr Murch said. Rebeka Hoffman, specialist GP and fellow of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, said lightning strikes primarily affected the heart and nervous system. ""The first thing we worry about is your heart,"" she said. ""Your heart can stop, it can go into a cardiac arrhythmia, an irregular beat, so it's important if you think or you do get struck by lightning that you do go to hospital for cardiac monitoring."" She said a strike was like ""like turning on 100 light bulbs all at once"". Lightning strike victims also suffer severe burns both at the site where the lightning goes in, and where it comes out. Dr Hoffman said trauma to the brain was another common injury, either from the lightning strike itself or from falling objects that are also caught in the lightning strike. ""What determines it is the strength of the storm — so how much electricity there is — as well as if there is something like a large tree branch, or a building, or something that falls on top of you at the same time,"" she said. ""The trauma associated with something falling is often as bad if not more significant than the lightning strike itself."" According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, lightning was responsible for 21 deaths across Australia in the 10 years to 2021. Data gathered by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows 210 people were taken to hospital with injuries caused by lightning from 2012 to 2022. A lightning strike is estimated to heat the air around it to a temperature at least four times hotter than the surface of the sun. Dr Hoffman said about 10 per cent of people who are struck by lightning will have ongoing complications. This can include arrhythmia, which is an irregular heartbeat, memory loss and other cognitive issues. ""What determines it is the strength of the storm — so how much electricity there is — as well as if there is something like a large tree branch, or a building, or something that falls on top of you at the same time,"" Dr Hoffman said. ""The long-term impacts of having a head injury are really significant [and] can impact things like your memory, your ability to function and self-care."" Research shows survivors can also present with psychological issues after being struck, including depression, PTSD and cognitive disturbance. If you are trying to help someone who has been struck by lightning, the most important thing to do is call triple-0 and request an ambulance.  According to Australia Wide First Aid, it is safe to approach and touch the person after a lightning strike because they no longer have electrical charge in them.  Next, check if the person is conscious and responsive. ",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-20/heres-what-happens-when-you-are-struck-by-lightning/103487890

ts88,"A dangerous form of asbestos has been detected at Sydney's Bicentennial Park as the number of contaminated sites across the city grows. Mulch at six new sites has tested positive for asbestos, according to the NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA).  Authorities are investigating how the banned mineral was mixed with the mainstream gardening material. A sample of friable asbestos, which is easily crushed into a powder by hand, was found in mulch at Bicentennial Park 1 in Glebe.  The NSW government identifies friable asbestos as high risk, while the state health department said breathing in asbestos fibres could cause asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma. Several samples of bonded asbestos were also found at the park. The sample of friable asbestos is deemed to be of ""low risk"" to the public after experts on the asbestos taskforce reviewed a report from the City of Sydney. NSW Health's Jeremy McAnulty said he had been informed by experts at the site that the sample was ""part of the material at the back of a tile"" at the park. He added that the sample couldn't ""be aerosolised or breathed in"", hence the low-risk rating. The City of Sydney have fenced off the foreshore area between Glebe Point Road and Johnstons Creek and put up signage to inform pedestrians and cyclists. The five other sites that tested positive for bonded asbestos are North Rosebery Park at Rosebery, a private aged care facility at St Ives, an industrial area in Rouse Hill, Mary Mackillop Catholic Parish at Oran Park and a private residence.  It takes the number of sites that have tested positive for asbestos across Greater Sydney to 47. The EPA has identified Greenlife Resource Recovery Facility as a common supplier across all contaminated sites but is investigating the ""complex supply chains involved"". Greenlife Resource Recovery Facility strenuously denies that the company is to blame. Parents whose children attend St Justin's Catholic Parish Primary School and St Benedict's Catholic College in Oran Park have been notified about the asbestos detected in the garden at Mary Mackillop Catholic Parish. The two schools are situated next to the parish. The Catholic Education Diocese of Wollongong sent out three letters to parents. The first letter, which was issued last Friday, revealed the garden was immediately closed off and locked once it was discovered ""mulch had been provided to the parish garden by Greenlife"". NSW EPA CEO Tony Chappel said the investigation into contaminated sites was ongoing but most of the concerning areas had been tested.

ts89,"Pure Origin certainly looks like a boutique Australian gin. It's got a curved glass bottle with a minimalist cream label and cork plug, and its own website detailing how the gin is made in ""all-copper Tasmanian pot stills"" using ""pure, pristine water from the slopes of Mount Wellington"". Oh, and it's won gin awards. Yet behind this $64 bottle of booze is one of Australia's biggest grocery giants. The only way you'd know its true origin is by turning over the bottle and finding the name of Coles' liquor subsidiary, James Busby, or by researching its trade mark.  Even Australian spirits wholesaler Kathleen Davies was initially confused when she recently picked up a bottle of Pure Origin in a Vintage Cellars store owned by Coles. ""I actually thought it was a small Tasmanian producer,"" she says. ""And I thought, how could they do it that cheap? ""They're mimicking small business and small spirit brands."" Pure Origin is just one example of how major liquor chains have made big strides into homebrand booze, in a way that is now so ubiquitous that even informed consumers may not know they're buying it. The liquor retailers say their homebrand and ""exclusive"" products are great for shoppers who want a tipple on a budget.  Critics say they're further cementing their market power. Australia's biggest liquor retailers include Woolworths spin-off Endeavour, Coles, IGA and Aldi.  According to IBISWorld analysis, Endeavour owns the biggest chunk of the market at 39.1 per cent, with Coles coming in second at 16.2 per cent. Its analysis is that liquor retailing itself has gotten more competitive in recent times, with smaller bottle shops and franchises under IGA Liquor growing. It is in this context of increasing competition that liquor retailers have been seeking to sell more of their own products. ""They control the costs of production. There's no marketing or wholesale costs involved,"" IBISWorld alcohol analyst Matthew Reeves says. ""And then they have a product that's exclusively on their shelves, which brings in greater customer loyalty."" ""It's really taken off, especially in wine and beer. Now we're seeing it more in spirits, seltzers and ready-to-drink [mixers]."" Yet it is hard to put a definitive figure on how much homebrand alcohol is now being sold, Mr Reeves says. In its last annual report, Coles revealed its ""exclusive liquor range"" sales grew by 8.5 per cent in 2023. This figure, however, was an undisclosed mixture of traditional private-label and exclusive-label products. ""Exclusive labels are the brands that are owned by other suppliers but available exclusively to Coles Liquor customers. Examples include Loch Lomond, Canard Duchene, Barry and Tradie,"" a spokesperson for the retailer told ABC News. ""Private labels are the beverage brands that Coles Liquor develops and owns, partnering with many suppliers across the industry, using our expert sourcing managers in wine, beer and spirits. Examples include Tinnies, Mayfair Gin & Beyond the Wilderness."" Coles confirmed Pure Origin is a private label. Media reports from when it launched in 2021 have it as being produced by a Tasmanian contract distiller. This highlights how the liquor chains are using manufacturers with existing infrastructure and expertise to create on-trend products on tight deadlines. IDL in regional Victoria is one sub-contractor that has benefited from the homebrand alcohol trend.  It started as a winery in the 1960s but today the Australian-owned private company has a massive facility with grape crushers, 150,000-litre tanks for storage of wine and cider, and a factory that is bottling up roughly one million bottles and cans every week. ""The infrastructure and investment that's required to put a packaging line in place, and have the know-how to put all the liquids in, is quite costly and time-consuming,"" IDL's head of sales James McDonnell says. As Mr McDonnell explains, it's not just the major liquor chains using their factory to make wine, seltzers, ciders, rum and tequila. IDL also holds contracts for major alcohol companies which also outsource their production at times, and Mr McDonnell has also noticed a trend of celebrities putting out alcohol products. Recent examples include Margot Robbie's gin and The Inspired Unemployed's beer release.  ""It's driven by the consumer and market trends changing so rapidly,"" he says. Mr McDonnell believes there will ""always be a place"" for alcohol brands that aren't owned or partially controlled by major liquor chains. However, the private-label trend has been ruffling feathers. The major liquor retailers already wield a lot of power. They hold huge inventories of sales data, and they can charge brands to promote their products in prime shelf positions or have them promoted in advertising campaigns and promotions.  Last year, several beer companies raised concerns in public hearings to the House of Representatives that private-label alcohol was further cementing the market power of major companies. ""Vertical integration of private-label beer continues to erode shelf space for independent brewers,"" Richard Adamson, who owns Young Henrys Brewery, told the public inquiry. ""We're getting further squeezed by retailers preferencing private-label products after they have met the terms of the majors,"" the managing director of Coopers Brewery, Dr Tim Cooper, also said. Dr Cooper and Mr Adamson both declined interviews. IBISWorld's analyst Mr Reeves says the homebrand alcohol trend is more likely to be hurting smaller producers than bigger established alcohol companies, such as Diageo or Asahi. ""The prices are on average about 50 per cent cheaper for the private labels,"" he says. ""Larger manufacturers (with) their economies of scale can probably bring that cost down to be a bit more competitive, but the smaller players are really restricted in their ability to do that."" ABC News approached about a dozen smaller alcohol manufacturers, some of whom voiced concerns about speaking out against the majors. On condition of anonymity, one independent distiller told ABC News that examples such as Pure Origin made their company ""feel overlooked"". ""We're producing our products and it's our main income stream,"" they said. ""A big box retailer doesn't manufacture the product so they're not having to deal with the hurdles of manufacturing in Australia that we do. ""And as it isn't their sole income stream, they can afford to lower the price point which makes it harder for the smaller brand to compete in the same space."" Kathleen Davies, who owns a website called Nip Of Courage that sells and wholesales Australian spirits, said she did hold some concerns for smaller and independent brands when it comes to private-label alcohol. ""It's almost deceiving the public because they're mimicking small business,"" she says. ""But there's pros and cons to it as well. I think what's great about some of the private labels is that it's made here in Australia.  ""They're using an Australian distillery to produce it, which is still important because it's giving that distillery cash flow."" Coles, Endeavour and Metcash all defended their supplier relationships. A spokesperson for Endeavour, which owns Dan Murphy's and BWS, said it had ""doubled the number of small, independent suppliers (stocked) since 2018 and smaller companies now make up 90 per cent"" of its supplier base. The company declined to supply a list of its private-label products but said it released 550 types instore in 2023 under its subsidiary Pinnacle. Pinnacle-linked products found in Endeavour stores by ABC News include the budget-friendly vodka Mishka, an imported Argentinian malbec Macho Gaucho, and a canned premix vodka and soda drink called Vo So. ",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-20/homebrand-alcohol-coles-endeavour-metcash-market-power/103478782
ts90,"Queensland's Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll has denied being a ""scapegoat"" as she announces she will step down from the top job next week.  Commissioner Carroll's last day will be next Friday, months out from when her contract was due to finish.  She was appointed to the role in 2019, becoming the first woman in the position after serving as commissioner of the Queensland Fire and Emergency Service.  ""Since the start of the year, I've had candid conversations with my husband, with my children, who have been unbelievably supportive, every step of the way,"" she said. ""I made this decision and was going to have the discussion about not renewing my contract with the minister in about two weeks' time, but because of the heightened speculation and commentary, I brought these discussions forward."" Commissioner Carroll said it was her decision to step down and that it was time for ""new leadership"" to let the focus turn to the work of her officers.  She said she wanted the ""air to be clear"", and refused to speculate on who would replace her.  ""The world has changed since COVID. To have in one year a 25 per cent increase in domestic violence is just unheard of, and that's in one year,"" she said. The commissioner and state government have been under increasing pressure over young offenders. Last week, Commissioner Carroll spoke to cabinet about youth crime, asking the government for more warrantless ""wand"" search powers, and an extension of GPS ankle monitors on young offenders.  Speaking today, she said the police response to youth crime had been ""outstanding"".  ""It is one of the most vexed and complex issues that we are dealing with,"" she said.  ""It's dangerous, it's escalating and it certainly is one of the biggest focuses of the QPS."" Commissioner Carroll also spoke about the 2022 Wieambilla murders.  Three shooters killed Constable Rachel McCrow, 29, Constable Matthew Arnold, 26, and neighbour Alan Dare in the Western Downs on December 12.  Those murders, and the on-duty death of Senior Constable Dave Masters in June 2021, were her darkest days, she said.  ""They were heart-wrenching moments which rocked our blue family, and I know this organisation will never forget the contributions of those fine officers,"" she said.  Police Minister Mark Ryan said Commissioner Carroll had ""kept her oath"" to serve Queensland.  ""You don't just end up commissioner of police by chance.

ts91,"WA Federal Labor senator Louise Pratt has announced she will retire from federal politics at the next election. Senator Pratt made the announcement with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at her electorate office in the Perth suburb of Belmont on Tuesday morning. She will stand down from the Senate, where she serves as the deputy government whip, when her term ends in mid-2025. Senator Pratt said health issues contributed to her decision. ""I have psoriatic arthritis and it is much better managed when I'm not flying, not chairing estimates and not whipping in the chamber,"" she said. ""I did the maths, and since being elected, I have literally spent … three months in the air, 24 hours a day off the ground."" She told Mr Albanese of her intention to retire about two weeks ago. Senator Pratt said making the announcement now allowed her party the chance to find suitable contenders to take over. ""This gives the Labor Party plenty of time to go through the appropriate processes to find a candidate or candidates, because we did after all elect three senators from Western Australia,"" she said. Senator Pratt was first elected to the Federal Senate in 2007, after six years in the WA Legislative Council. She was defeated at the 2013 election in controversial circumstances, with the High Court ordering a fresh Senate election in WA after more than 1,000 votes were lost during a recount. But she was elected to the Senate again in 2016, and re-elected in 2019. The senator served as a shadow assistant minister for a number of portfolios during Labor's time in opposition. ""When I lost my seat in 2013 … and the prime minister became Tony Abbott, I had really good reason to fight to come back,"" she said. ""But I can say now I have absolute confidence in the agenda of Prime Minister Albanese."" Senator Pratt reflected on spending much of her political career campaigning for the rights of members of the LGBTIQA+ community, including supporting the 2017 change to the Marriage Act to allow marriage equality. She married her partner Rebecca Misich in 2023. ""I have to say, nothing compares to that feeling of changing the law or marriage and then being able to get married,"" she said. Mr Albanese paid tributes to Senator Pratt's service, and the commitment involved in working in federal politics while based in WA. ""I understand that more so than anywhere else in the country, it's a big ask to travel across to the east coast,"" he said. ""Louise has never been anyone who sat in the Senate just to occupy the seat.

ts92,"There's an uncomfortable reality most of our political leaders are unwilling to confront. To a degree, they've shied away from dealing with it, as the fix inevitably will involve pain for some. And that makes it easy to mount a scare campaign that can undermine an election campaign. Just ask Bill Shorten. But housing rapidly is becoming a lightning rod for a generation staring down the prospect of having next to no hope of buying a residence under their own steam. We may see ourselves as an egalitarian society with a universal education and health system that provides opportunities for anyone willing to have a go. During the past 30 years, however, it has become increasingly the case that the main avenue for gaining entry into the housing market is through inheritance. If your family didn't own property, there's only a slim chance you will if you're on a normal wage. While the trend isn't unique to Australia, there are several unique factors here that are making the problem inherently worse than in many other developed countries. Most of those problems are related to excess demand. Despite the constant baying from certain vested interests that we simply need to unwind planning controls and aim for the skies, it would be almost impossible to build enough dwellings to cope with the enormous rate of increase in our population. And then there is the thorny question of our tax system. Thanks to a policy forged in a bygone era and turbocharged around the turn of the century, a large proportion of our wealthiest citizens have been encouraged to own multiple properties, ensuring prices remain out of reach for the next generation. There are two ways. Neither is politically palatable nor attainable without serious economic fallout. The first is to have real estate prices go backwards or at least stand still for a very long time. Imagine going to an election with that as your main platform. The millions of Australians who own houses would be aghast. Then consider the ramifications for the banking system. Remember, it was a residential real estate collapse in America that sparked the global financial crisis. The second is to dramatically lift wages and income so that ordinary Australians once again could afford to put a roof over their heads. But that would unleash an inflation inferno and with demand outstripping supply, send real estate values into the stratosphere. Unfortunately, there are no quick and easy solutions to the problems we've created. Most of the so-called ""affordable housing solutions"" are simply attempts to create an illusion that our leaders are doing something. At best, they operate at the margins. The worst ideas, such as allowing first home buyers to tap into their superannuation, would only add to demand and deliver windfall gains to sellers while denuding younger generations of a retirement income. The arithmetic isn't difficult. Last year our population swelled dramatically as an immigration wave held back by years of COVID-inspired isolation pushed our cities to bursting point. More than 600,000 new arrivals landed in the country, many of them students. They all need somewhere to live. Unfortunately, the pace of housing construction slowed to its lowest level since 2013 with just 165,602 new dwellings commenced in the year to the end of last September. A mere 37,116 were started in the September quarter, down 17 per cent on the previous year. That trend seems to be worsening with a 10 per cent drop in building approvals in the December quarter. Not surprisingly, since January last year, Australian property prices have been on a tear, recouping almost all the losses incurred after the Reserve Bank of Australia began raising interest rates in 2022. Those 13 rate hikes have had a perverse impact on property. They curbed building activity, which has tightened supply, but have done little to moderate demand in a market buoyed both by increased population and a resurgence in demand from cashed-up older generations. Paul Keating tried to wind it back in 1985. It didn't encourage new housing construction, he argued, and it allowed wealthier Australians to lower their taxes. ""The leader of the opposition would allow all the high-income earners to run interest costs against their income, swapping flats on Bondi Beach which were built 40 years ago,"" he told parliament back then. ""That is not adding to the stock of housing or to the stock of rental accommodation, it is not really assisting families who need rental accommodation."" How little things have changed. Within three years, he would succumb to a wave of intense lobbying and reinstate the system we now have. Negative gearing is controversial because, while it is standard practice to be able to write off business costs, like interest payments, against business revenue, in Australia, we go one step further. We allow those costs or losses to be written off against personal income. More than a million Australians own a negatively geared property. Treasury estimates that it cost the federal budget around $2.7 billion in foregone taxes in 2020-21, when interest rates were at record lows. The cost will only have risen sharply since, alongside rates. Worse than that, because the bulk of investors buy established properties, they're competing against other buyers, and pricing younger buyers out of the market because the tax incentives mean they can afford to pay over the odds. Overwhelmingly, investors are well-heeled. Last week, the Commonwealth Bank's half-year earnings results contained this graph. It shows when it comes to investment loans, about 80 per cent of applicants in the six months to the end of December earned more than $150,000 a year with the vast bulk pulling in up to $500,000. And that's why the Albanese government suddenly is in the crosshairs since expanding the stage 3 tax cuts to lower income groups. Bill Shorten's proposal in the 2019 election campaign, to in future only allow negative gearing for those wanting to buy newly built properties, would have added to the supply of housing and taken the heat out of the market for existing properties. But Australia has a history of shooting down sensible proposals, particularly when it comes to tax. It's easy to mount a scare campaign, torpedo real reform and scare off future governments from ever trying again. The longer the problem persists, the more difficult it becomes to fix. Trying to convince voters who only recently purchased property that you want to slow the price of their biggest investment is an election strategy fraught with danger. Two things stood out in the December home loan numbers released a fortnight ago. The first was that housing investors were plunging back into the market, possibly with the scent of rate cuts down the track fuelling expectations of even further price hikes. But first-home buyers were also buying with their ears pinned back. Newby loans jumped more than 21 per cent compared to the previous December. Investors were close behind with 20 per cent growth. We know where the investors are getting their cash. They're earning oodles, according to the graph above. And they can afford to outbid others because any losses they make on the shortfall between rent and interest costs will be covered by the taxpayer. While the evidence has yet to be gathered, the re-entry of first-home buyers is likely a sign that those with wealthy parents – based primarily on the house they live in – are helping fund their offspring into housing with an early inheritance. Meanwhile, we're witnessing a shortage of supply while demand is ramping up from a huge lift in population, fuelled by incredibly generous tax breaks. It's a formula that bodes well for real estate agents and landholders. As for those wanting something affordable? Not so much. Editor's note: An initial version of the story cited Treasury's estimate that more than $27 billion of revenue will be forgone due to rental deductions in 2023-24. This figure includes deductions made by positively geared property investors. It has been replaced with Treasury's latest (2020-21) estimate for the revenue lost from rental loss (negative gearing) deductions of $2.7 billion.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-20/the-death-of-affordable-housing-and-curse-of-negative-gearing/103486878
ts93,"Coles and Woolworths say they're looking out for you – they are the fresh food people or the home of everyday low prices. But this narrative has fractured over the last year as shoppers, workers and farmers feel the squeeze of the powerful duopoly. Four Corners has spoken to insiders, experts, and the supermarket CEOs themselves to find out just how they operate. Here's what you need to know about how they keep prices high and competitors out. Our supermarket sector is one of the least competitive in the world. Coles and Woolworths control 65 per cent of the grocery market. Aldi has just 10 per cent. On average, for every $10 Australians pay for groceries, $6.50 of that is spent at the big two. The UK has five major players vying for a cut of that $10. The US has multiple supermarket chains. Last year Woolworths' costs of doing business were flat but its profit margin from selling groceries grew from 5.3 to 6 per cent. That's an extra $318 million in profits in one year alone. Coles saw a small increase in costs, pushing its profit margin down slightly to 4.8 per cent. Supermarket aisles are littered with signs boasting ""Special"", ""Low"" or ""Locked"" prices. What you might not know is that often grocery suppliers and brands are expected to fund these promotions. That means suppliers will often set their recommended retail price at a higher level, knowing they have to offer deep discounts for much of the year. An item that a supplier can afford to sell for $15 for some of the year might initially be listed at $30 just so it can later be promoted as 50 per cent off. There are other costs for suppliers wanting to do business with the big two, including in-house advertising and promotions. A full-page ad in Woolworths' Fresh Magazine costs $30,000. A spot on Coles radio is worth $28,000. They even charge suppliers a fee if stock is damaged while being sold on their shelves. All these extra costs demanded by the supermarkets flow into higher grocery prices at the check-out. The big two compete for customers, but there's often little difference in prices. Julian Hilliard's worked in retail for 38 years, including as a buyer or category manager for Coles and Woolworths. The buying decisions he made would affect stock and prices in stores across the country. He says when he worked for Woolworths, if Coles put up a price, they would quickly follow. ""They're more or less identical in many respects."" ""I would probably say that if you did five shops in Woolworths and five shops in Coles … you'd be a few cents difference maybe depending on the specials."" Rod Sims, who headed the consumer watchdog ACCC for 11 years, says the lack of competition means shoppers are losing out. ""There's no doubt we are paying higher prices than we should,"" Mr Sims says. ""All the economic evidence in supermarkets, or similar sectors all around the world, say that when you get this much concentration, you're going to get higher prices."" Insiders accuse the ""big two"" of exploiting their market power to pressure suppliers and increase their profits. Leaked emails show how Coles dealt with one multinational supplier who wanted to increase prices on its products. While Coles initially expressed concern about the impact on customers, when the supplier made a one-off payment of $25,000 the retailer agreed to the price increase. A source, who works for the multinational supplier, says Coles then passed on the full price rise to customers. Coles chief executive Leah Weckert says that does not amount to price gouging. ""We have a team of people whose job it is to look to validate cost, price increases and we take that job very seriously."" Meanwhile, an industry insider says Woolworths began a campaign 18 months ago to increase its profit margins – asking to ""share"" in any price increases it granted to its suppliers. It worked by the supermarket directly requesting some of the price increase back from suppliers in the form of a rebate. That meant consumers ended up paying more, and suppliers did not get the full price increase, but Woolworths significantly increased its profit margins. Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci says the company does not employ the tactic. He says Woolworths is ""very keen to make sure we don't pass on anything more to our customers than is required"". Coles and Woolworths use their market power to push their own homebrand products. Because shoppers often have no idea, these are known as ""phantom brands"". In a Coles-owned bottle shop, like First Choice or Vintage Cellars, there are about 260 homebrand wines on the shelves. Take this bottle of Two Churches shiraz, sold in Coles' Vintage Cellars … Online, and through the image on the bottle, the wine has been promoted as a tale from the Barossa Valley – telling the story of two Lutheran priests with rival churches bonding over the quality of the region's grapes. There's no Coles logo anywhere on the bottle, but look closely and the address in small print on the back is Hawthorn East in Melbourne — Coles' corporate headquarters. ""I think they're sort of misleading the consumer to a certain degree on putting this on the shelf as a branded product,"" fifth-generation Barossa grape grower Adrian Hoffmann says. ""It sounds like a Barossa story, but you can't be guaranteed it's Barossa fruit, unfortunately."" After questions from Four Corners, references to the Barossa were removed from Coles' websites promoting the wine. Coles CEO Leah Weckert says she wasn't familiar with Two Churches but that the company is ""very comfortable"" that its approach to branding ""is one that resonates with customers"". One recent example shows how the promise of some supermarket promotions isn't always kept. Coles announced last year it had ""locked"" prices on a range of items. But consumer group Choice found the retailer had then raised these prices earlier than it promised. Coles conceded there were 20 ""locked"" items where prices were raised, including Corn Flakes, barbecue briquettes, dishwashing tablets, and thickened cream. Choice campaigns director Rosie Thomas says Coles has started refunding people who shopped online or have Flybuys accounts. ""But there will still be a large number of consumers who bought these products in store. Unless they show up with receipts, they're not going to get refunds,"" she says. Despite having misled consumers, Coles was not fined or sanctioned. Coles CEO Leah Weckert says the company's worked on its processes to ensure it doesn't happen again. ""We have refunded substantially more than what the benefit was to Coles from the increase in price,"" Ms Weckert says. One of the key tactics the big two use to fight off competitors is through controlling land. They scour the country and buy up sites years before they even get approvals to build. If they get the green light, it's a new shopping complex. If not, they've at least kept their rivals out. German supermarket giant Kaufland abandoned plans to enter the Australian market in 2020. Media reports said a lack of suitable sites was one factor. In one growing community west of Brisbane, Woolworths has bought more than 6 hectares of land over 11 years. But an actual supermarket is still years away. Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci says it's not about keeping out competitors. ""It'll be … we need a store in a new area and so you'll buy some land and wait for the community to start moving into the area."" Your last grocery delivery or click-and-collect order may have come from a dark store. These look like normal supermarkets, with aisles, a deli, and a bakery, but instead of customers, there are dozens of staff filling orders. But conditions aren't always like a normal supermarket. On a recent stifling day, temperatures inside this Sydney dark store hit 34 degrees Celsius. ""Every summer there's people who feel dizzy, every summer there's people whose sweat's just dripping off them and they want to sit down, but you get a 15-minute break in a five-hour shift,"" Ana Robertson, who works at this dark store, says. Workers gathering items for online orders are timed, and there are targets set. ""There is an industry standard of a pick rate of about 180 items per hour. Our warehouse, particularly during busy periods, will push you to go above and beyond that, which might be 210, 220 [items per hour],"" Ana says. She says in the past, the names of pickers who were falling behind were displayed in red for staff to see. Coles CEO Leah Weckert says ""team member safety is absolutely crucial"". Coles said in a statement it's put in place a number of measures to help employees on hot days, including providing them with chilled neckties. Fruit and vegetables are crucial for getting shoppers through the front door at Coles and Woolworths. Jeremy Griffith, who sits on the horticulture council at the National Farmers Federation, says when it comes to negotiating prices, the big two hold all the cards. ""The retailers are acutely aware of this issue and they can leverage it, they can exploit it … offering very super, super low prices to the growers knowing full well that at the end of the day, the grower has almost no choice but to accept."" Third-generation cherry farmer Michael Cunial was one of those growers. He's now getting out of the industry. ""We're at the mercy of them. We're price takers. So the profit just isn't there anymore,"" he says. ""There's a huge, huge imbalance. Supermarkets are making these multi-billion-dollar profits and growers are losing money."" Coles CEO Leah Weckert says farmers do have other options, like selling to independent grocers, the food service market or the export market. ""We work closely with our suppliers because we know our suppliers have to be successful for us to be successful,"" she says. Politicians from all sides are now talking about taking on the supermarket duopoly. Multiple inquiries and reviews have been called into the sector, including: Some are clear about what needs to change. Former ACCC boss Rod Sims says Australia needs tougher merger laws. That would allow the watchdog to curtail Coles and Woolworth's ability to gobble up rivals, buy land and move into other industries. ""I think there's no doubt … if you want consumers to pay less for goods in supermarkets, change the merger laws,"" he says. The Greens, who are chairing the upcoming Senate inquiry into supermarket prices, are exploring more radical change, including breaking up Coles and Woolworths. ""The acid test on the Prime Minister is not going to be what reviews or what processes he's prepared to put in place. It'll be what action he's prepared to take,"" inquiry chair and Greens Senator Nick McKim says. Want to know more about how Coles and Woolworths operate?

ts94,"At least once a fortnight, Zach, a Sydney man in his early 30s, consumes an illicit drug. ""I typically use cocaine and ketamine. I'll occasionally — probably like once a month if not less frequently — have MDMA as well."" Zach knows the drugs he buys could contain things he might not be aware of. He says it's common knowledge that drugs in Australia are low quality, often cut with benign fillers by suppliers to maximise profits. He says he trusts his dealer wouldn't deliberately harm him. However, Zach knows there are cases where drugs containing unexpected substances can be harmful. In late January, following three hospital admissions, NSW Health put out a warning about ecstasy, a pill typically containing MDMA, that may contain a nitazene, a new group of synthetic opioids. These are potentially very dangerous — for example one kind of nitazene is estimated to be 25 times stronger than fentanyl. For Zach, the prospect of consuming a drug like a nitazene is terrifying. He says while no-one he knows has overdosed, friends of friends have done so through the use of drugs that contained unexpected substances. ""I think most people expect it to be cut with garbage or fillers, rather than the direct opposite of what you're after,"" he says. To avoid this, Zach is maintaining a positive relationship with his dealer and only consuming small amounts of his chosen drugs. He says if he took something that didn't feel like it should, he likes to think he ""would just stop using it"". But he says if there was a public drug checking service, he'd ""be all over it"". Increasingly entirely synthetic substances are being detected across the world. Known as novel psychoactive substances (NPS), these drugs tend to be stronger and cheaper than traditional illicit drugs. Increasingly NPS are being found in traditional drugs like MDMA or cocaine. It's not uncommon for drugs to contain unexpected substances. Chemistry lead of CanTEST, Australia's only fixed-site drug checking service, Malcolm McLeod told ABC RN's Life Matters that ""around 10 per cent to 15 per cent of samples [are] maybe not as expected"". But NPS could mean users are at an increased risk of harm. It's a risk that has experts calling for more public drug-checking services in Australia. Novel psychoactive substances are synthetic drugs ranging from slightly tweaked variations of known substances (known as analogues) to entirely new drugs. Over the last 15 years, the volume and variety of these new drugs has increased, with around 1,300 new drugs found in 140 countries so far. Dimitri Gerostamoulos is the head of forensic science at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine and he has researched the rise of NPS and their associated risks. ""These new substances have featured in quite a lot of deaths that have been reported to coroners right around the country and in other institutions around the world,"" he says. This could be because NPS can be cheaper and simpler to produce than more traditional drugs, and potentially not illegal, while also being more potent. ""The potency of some of these drugs has increased, which means that the dose required to elicit an effect is usually a lot less,"" Dr Gerostamoulos says. But this potency also means risk, particularly with inconsistent dosages. ""We also have found that there is quite a lot of substitution happening with the traditional drugs,"" Dr Gerostamoulos adds. And he says another concern is how little researchers know about NPS and their interactions with other drugs, including prescription medication. One approach to minimising these risks could be increased public drug-checking services, like CanTEST and pill testing. Drug-checking services range in format and effectiveness. In a service like CanTEST, members of the public can have substances tested for purity and ingredients. Once they have the results, harm reduction workers provide information about these substances, including their risk. In January, CanTEST confirmed the discovery of three previously unidentified drugs in Australia, describing them as ""unexpected, new psychoactive substances"". This information can be valuable to mitigate potential poisonings and overdoses. ""We're working with an unregulated drugs market,"" says Monica Barratt, an RMIT vice chancellor's senior research fellow. She has previously called for an increase in drug-checking services to address the risks of NPS. ""Prohibition essentially means there are no regulations. There are no ways in which these drugs are tested before they're put out there, like a pharmaceutical drug would be."" ""When these NPS are sold as something else or they're added to common illicit drugs, we don't know what the outcome is going to be. It's unpredictable,"" says Nicole Lee, an adjunct professor at the National Drug Research Institute. Research shows that drug-checking services can reduce harm. In 2021, a systematic review of 90 studies concluded the information provided by drug-checking services influenced users to avoid taking the tested substances. Dr Barratt says drug checking is based on a philosophy of providing people with information about a substance they intended to take. ""Anything that reduces harm from then on, we see as a win. Be that the discard of the drug … but it can also be taking it in less dangerous circumstances, or maybe not taking it in combination with another substance."" While there is research supporting drug-checking services reducing harm, there appears to be political reluctance from some quarters. Currently, the ACT is the only jurisdiction to introduce public drug-checking services, while Queensland announced in February 2023 that it planned to introduce these systems. A Queensland Health spokesperson told the ABC ""work is underway to introduce drug-checking services early to mid-2024"". No other state or territory has committed to similar plans. In January, Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan said she was seeking further expert advice over introducing the service statewide. Her announcement came after both the Victorian coroner and 77 community agencies called for drug checking to address the risks of NPS. And other states seem reluctant to introduce public drug checking. In October, NSW Health Minister Ryan Park said pill testing was not a ""silver bullet"" to stop drug-related deaths. Both the Tasmanian and Western Australian governments have historically shot down calls for drug-checking services for the public. In 2021, then-NT chief minister Michael Gunner said he was open to a trial on pill testing, but the territory has not yet announced any plans for its introduction. In a statement to the ABC, a NSW government spokesperson said that there ""remain very real questions"" on drug-checking services, including that ""it doesn't take into account an individual's physiology"". According to Professor McLeod, CanTEST uses the same equipment as police and forensic laboratories around the country, run by qualified chemists. He says one technology used at CanTEST is accurate within a few per cent. But while there are limitations to drug-checking services, those who support them say doing something is better than doing nothing. Dr Lee says the end point is ""that at least there's some checking and some additional knowledge about the potential risks with all types of drug checking"". Some research also suggests current approaches to discourage drug use may be having unintended consequences, such as increasing the risk of overdose. Dr Barratt says reducing drug harms requires a multi-pronged attack. ""I think it's possible for us to do multiple things. We can have supply reduction, we can have demand reduction, and we can have harm reduction, because it's a practical response when we know that saying, 'Just say no', doesn't work for a lot of people,"" she says.

ts95,"Veterinarian Sarah Pollard-Williams has often treated racing greyhounds with fractured legs that go on to make a full recovery. She said it was a common injury caused by the curved design of the tracks the dogs usually raced around. ""Once you get tracks that have turns in them, and obviously the greyhounds want to race to the inside [and] not going wide around the outside, that puts significant stress on those limbs,"" Dr Pollard-Williams said. New research by the Coalition for the Protection of Greyhounds has found many dogs were being euthanased off the track after sustaining racing injuries such as leg fractures. The lobby group found across Australia last year, 120 greyhounds were euthanased on the track and 194 euthanased off-track after suffering injuries while racing. In Victoria, 31 dogs were euthanased on track and 65 were euthanased off-track after suffering serious injuries while racing. Queensland followed closely, with 12 greyhounds euthanased on track and 69 euthanased off-track after serious injuries. The researchers claim the dogs were generally euthanased a week or two after being injured, though many just two to three days afterwards. The coalition used information from two racing industry databases, as well as publicly available stewards' reports which do not include deaths that occur away from the racetrack. Victorian organiser at the coalition, Joanne Lee told ABC Gippsland's Breakfast radio program the racing industry was trying to manipulate track death statistics by euthanasing greyhounds off-track. ""The racing industry would like the public to believe dog deaths are decreasing. It's a common line they usually share because the public don't want to see dogs die,"" she said. The research also found 45 greyhound deaths in Australia were attributed to illness post-injury, inability to be rehomed, or were listed as deceased with no reason. Dr Pollard-Williams said she was ""not very surprised"" greyhounds were being euthanased with injuries that could likely be treated. ""If greyhounds can't earn a buck for their owners, they're considered extremely disposable,"" she said. A spokesperson for Greyhounds Australasia, which includes representatives from racing industry bodies across Australia and New Zealand, said every greyhound death was tracked. ""Around Australia, racing regulations require that every greyhound death, both on track and outside of racing, be reviewed and recorded,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""This is part of the racing industry's commitment to transparency about its operations. Data relating to greyhound welfare, including deaths from all causes, is available in a wide range of publicly available reports. ""[The data] is also independently audited, so we reject any claim that data is being manipulated or misrepresented."" The spokesperson said euthanasia that occurred off-track could not always ""be attributed to racing injuries"". ""This category includes euthanasia because of illness and non-racing injury. Total death statistics also include greyhounds who died of natural causes,"" they said. ""As is the case for any animal, euthanasia is a decision made by a qualified veterinarian, who is best placed to determine the most appropriate care in all the circumstances."" Last year, politicians and greyhound advocates called for an independent inquiry into Victoria's racing industry. Ms Lee said the coalition now wants a federal inquiry examining the future of greyhound racing. ""The industry we believe is desperate to do all they can to fool the public into believing that there's an ethical way to exploit these innocent dogs. We don't think there is,"" she said. Ms Lee said this was not the first time the greyhound racing industry's ""manipulation of death data"" had been uncovered. ""There was a report in New South Wales released in 2015 that revealed the same practice where the industry … was telling stewards not to include on-track deaths,"" she said, referring to a report prepared off the back of the state's commission of inquiry into greyhound racing. A spokesperson for the federal government said responsibility for the management and welfare of the greyhound industry rested with state and territory governments. ""The Australian government has committed $5 million over four years to the renewal of an Australian Animal Welfare Strategy,"" the spokesperson said. They said the renewed strategy was expected to ""provide a vision for the welfare of all animals and promote harmonised national standards and guidelines development"".  ""Animal welfare is a priority for the community, the agriculture industry and the Australian government,"" the spokesperson said. There have been several inquiries into greyhound racing in the past decade, including in New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania. Following the state's inquiry last year, the South Australian government gave the greyhound racing industry two years to improve its standards, or the sport would be banned.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-20/research-on-racing-greyhounds-deaths-injuries/103443144
ts96,"Much attention has been paid in recent times to Australia's over-reliance on American power for our national defence. But far more of our sovereignty has been eroded beneath us by far more insidious means: our extraordinary and increasing reliance on the United States, and China, for technology.  For individual citizens going about their day, for the critical infrastructure which enables the functioning of our society, and even our national defence, this weakness has now accelerated beyond the point of no return. This vast technology gap has eaten deeply into Australia's ability to determine its own path. In creating software, in the engineering of critical componentry and in the storage of sensitive data, this gulf is now so vast, it has become impossible to bridge. To endeavour to catch up to the US, for example, would cost so much as to be economic suicide, akin to trying to build a rival space or even nuclear weapons program. The evidence of this slide into dependence is everywhere. As individuals, we are subjugated by our smartphones, none of which are designed, programmed or, least of all, manufactured here. Our national debates about privacy and surveillance are important but increasingly irrelevant, because those conducting the surveillance or dismantling our privacy are not here; they're far away, and they're governed by foreign law. The same is true of the systems which control our national infrastructure, from dams and energy grids, to banks and communication systems. On the other side of the Pacific, US politicians are deeply concerned about the way companies like Google and Microsoft are increasingly governing the lives of Americans and stamping out competition. Efforts by Congress to regulate the sector have run up against a sophisticated lobbying campaign to prevent it doing so. But at least America's legislature is trying. Here, Australia's parliament is sleepy and unconcerned. ""It amuses me to see Americans in a panic about the power and scale of big technology companies,"" said David Elliot, head of Canberra software company Agile Digital. ""They're nervous … and yet they're at the top of the pile.""' Overwhelmed by the digital revolution, Elliot says Australia is losing the ability to even comprehend the technologies it is bringing in from overseas. ""We are becoming more and more dependent as our critical infrastructure becomes increasingly reliant on 'black box' technologies,"" he said. ""Once a society doesn't understand how things work, it's walking on the path towards magical thinking."" The most recent, acute example of this technology dependence is the impact of Microsoft's decision two years ago to withdraw much of its work for foreign governments, including ours. Despite tendering to deliver a Top Secret cloud for the Australian government's most sensitive data, then negotiating throughout 2021 with the Department of Defence and the Office of National Intelligence, Microsoft pulled the pin, with no warning, mid-way through 2022. To their credit, our officials had been demanding that Microsoft meet stringent criteria for local, sovereign control over our data. The effect of Microsoft's decision exposed our vulnerability and was damaging for a string of secretive projects. One is a $500 million data integration scheme being pursued by Defence, which began to fall apart after Microsoft quit. The cold reality is that Australia may have already lost the ability to store its own data. Certainly, decision-makers believe they have little choice but to call upon the so-called ""hyperscale"" trio: Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS or Google Cloud. At a Senate Estimates hearing last week, Chris Crozier, Defence's Chief Information Officer, admitted as much. Some overseas companies have become indispensable. ""Sovereign capability cannot provide hyperscale,"" he said. ""You've got to go to the global platforms"". As consolation, he promised cameo roles for Australian firms. Vault Cloud, a local data storage company certified by the Australian Signals Directorate, is playing such a role; it picked up a $3 million contract with Defence after Microsoft's sudden departure. Vault Cloud's boss, Rupert Taylor-Price, is among a group of Australian technology executives who have been vocal about Canberra's growing dependency problem. He says complex components and software, designed and built overseas, increasingly control ""everything from our water supply to the means by which we fire our missiles"". ""Many people have failed to grasp,"" he said, ""that if you lose the sovereignty of IT platforms you lose the sovereignty of your critical infrastructure."" The peak of the Black Summer fires of 2020 offers another example. With the country ablaze, authorities were alarmed to be told that their access to a global geosynchronous satellite program — to obtain real-time pictures of the fires which would eventually kill almost 500 people — would be subject to a 24-hour delay. Australia might have paid $1 billion for privileged access to the program, but, if you haven't already guessed, it's the US military which controls it. I asked Rob Rogers about the delay. He was then deputy commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service and is now its boss. He says it renders the satellite capacity ""absolutely useless"". ""We also found that some of the trajectories of those satellites were not generous to us as a country and didn't give us the amount of mapping they gave to parts of the United States."" Defence is now procuring its own far-orbit satellites in a bid for sovereign control. No small irony then, that last year it gave the contract to US multinational Lockheed Martin. This impotence is only to become starker as artificial intelligence creeps into a greater and greater proportion of new technology, says Elliot. ""These technologies are largely trained overseas,"" he said. ""When you ask an AI a question it will generally compose an answer based on foreign training data, and we will likely not know what that data was or what bias is present in its answers. ""As we hand over our agency in decision-making to autonomous machines it's becoming a more serious issue for our nation that we fully understand how they work."" I stumbled over an extraordinary example of this recently, trawling aimlessly through a list of government transactions. The contract's title is ""AWS Generative Artificial Intelligence Discovery Proof of Concept on Parliamentary Submissions"", and its procurer is the corporate watchdog, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Amazed, I asked for an explanation. In essence, ASIC said it is becoming too onerous to read public submissions to parliamentary inquiries — particularly the inquiry now investigating the Commonwealth's use of the big four consulting firms. ""As the submissions grow, it becomes increasingly challenging with limited resources to read and summarise all submissions with a short turnaround,"" ASIC's spokeswoman told me. (In case you were wondering how many are too many, the current inquiry has 75 submissions on its website.) ""The ability of LLMs [Large Language Model AIs] to summarise documents quickly is well publicised and this activity suggests itself as an ideal and low risk way for ASIC to test the technology."" Of course, this is only a trial, a so-called ""proof of concept"", but a glimpse of the future nonetheless. Consider ASIC's initiative through the prism of Elliot's warning about bias: here, a vital public institution, the corporate cop no less, is seeking to rely on an overseas-trained, black-box technology, to filter the correspondence of citizens to their own parliament. No-one would sensibly advocate for trying to build a technological industrial base to compete with the US or China. But elsewhere, particularly in the European Union, this challenge is being met head-on by enterprising elected officials. Together with the pursuit of antitrust cases against large technology firms, the EU has actively sought tough regulation on issues such as data storage. It is demanding the power to control the facilities and software which houses its information, as well as protections from notorious anti-competitive conduct. The big tech firms have had little choice but to accept it. Paris was so resolute, for example, that Google was forced to partner with French firm Thales to ""co-develop"" a local cloud service. Back home, there are obvious fixes. At the minute, Australia has no laws which mandate that its data must be held onshore (with a minor exception for health information). And of the roughly $10 billion a year the Commonwealth spends on information technology, the majority flows straight offshore, much of it into tax havens. Surely more must be spent here? Any change will be hard-won. As entrenched as they now are in Australian society, these companies won't simply yield. When the Department of Home Affairs released a discussion paper on ""data localisation"" two years ago, Facebook, Apple, Twitter and Google immediately kicked back. The proposal has gathered dust ever since. Attempts at genuine regulation will require not only an active parliament, but a government able to withstand intense lobbying — including, it should be pointed out, from the White House.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-20/australia-loss-relying-on-us-china-technology/103484844
ts97,"The sign on the chalkboard next to the pool table was clear: ""No name, no game."" We'd arrived in the Gemfields in central Queensland just a few hours earlier and, after a quick reccy for the following day of filming, retreated to Rubyvale's pub for a meal. I don't mind a game of pool, so I added my name to the list and sized up my opponent – a middle-aged woman who twirled a pink pool cue menacingly between long fingernails painted in the same fluorescent colour. She told me to call her Chonny. I was immediately intimidated. Needless to say, the game was over quickly, and the loser – me – had to buy the next round. When Chontelle ""Chonny"" Penfold isn't hustling the pool table, she's hunting for sapphires on her block of land about 10 minutes out of town. During Queensland's more temperate winter months, she and her husband drive from their home on the New South Wales southern coast to try their luck fossicking. About an hour west of Emerald, small towns like Rubyvale and Sapphire are part of one of the world's largest sapphire-bearing regions. Back in the old days, the 900-square-kilometre area was like the Wild West, with guns drawn and threats against trespassers taken seriously. Chonny promises me it's a lot calmer these days. She is among a new age of gem hunters like Matt Betteridge. Young and ambitious, Matt came to visit the region in 2012 and ended up staying. Matt's famous for scratching at some hard soil one day and unearthing an 834-carat gem, estimated to be worth about $12,000. He uploaded it to TikTok, and his discovery went viral. Matt's wife Amber Betteridge – with a name that seems almost too perfect to be true – brings Matt's rough gems to life using the machine that belonged to her grandfather and they then sell them online. Matt took me back to the spot where he found his big gem, telling me it could easily be my lucky day. But the best specimen I found was a type of rock Matt called ""leaverite"", which he quickly explained meant it was nothing special. ""That looks like a nice piece of Leav-er-rite,"" he laughed. ""As in, leave 'er right where you found it."" Debbie Wouters is also a newcomer who arrived from Gippsland, Victoria, in 2022. She and her husband Steve packed up their lives and headed north after Debbie went through a life-changing illness. Now, she spends her life underground and is already running the local lapidary club where gem hunters gather to trade tips. ""I can stay down here for about four hours at a time,"" Debbie tells me after we've descended 14 metres down the lift into her mine. ""It's quite comfortable because it's too hot upstairs."" If you want to try your hand at gem hunting, get yourself a pick and a sieve. No machinery is permitted and you'll need a fossicking licence. Then head to one of the Gemfields' designated recreational fossicking areas to prospect or speck. You can walk along and kick over old mounds of dumped soil, or you can dig down and find the gravel layer known as ""wash"". Either way, put that soil or gravel through your sieve and see if something shows up. You're looking for a rock that looks like glass. Debbie and Steve say if it winks at you, don't take your eye off it because it will disappear as quickly as you find it. SOURCE: Qld Government If you catch gemstone fever, you can buy a surface claim that allows you to use your pick to dig down to about 2m. And if you want to get really serious, you can buy a mining claim that allows you to go deep underground and use a jackhammer to dig away at the rock. These claims can set you back between $5,000 and $100,000. The price difference depends on the amount of untouched ground there is, whether it's a surface or underground claim, and how valuable the machinery or shelters on top are. On my final night in Rubyvale, I challenged Chonny to another round of pool. Her husband Graeme shook his head at my hopefulness and offered a lure. ""If you can beat her, I'll give you a couple of sapphires,"" he said. Maybe Chonny was feeling sorry for me, or just maybe I was having a good night, but I walked out of that pub with a small plastic bag containing a couple of small, rough gems and a smile on my face. It seems you can strike it lucky in the Gemfields.

ts98,"For the second time in as many months, Papua New Guinea is reeling from significant bloodshed. On Sunday, a massacre unfolded in PNG's Highlands in Enga Province in an area that has seen consistent tribal fighting for years. Police are constantly amending and updating their death toll, with the latest count at 49 dead. Just last year, dozens were killed in tit-for-tat tribal conflicts across Enga, with fighting supercharged by increased access to firearms. The province was put into a temporary lockdown, as police tried to restrict the movement of guns and ammunition into the region. With the sheer number of those shot dead on Sunday, it appears considerable firepower has continued to make its way into villages, with catastrophic results. Tribal fighting, common in PNG's highlands, can break out over a range of reasons, such as politics, land disputes, inter-marriage issues and so on. What has changed though, making it all the more difficult for police and defence to bring under control, is that these clans are now fighting each other with guns, not bush knives or other weapons. One police officer told the ABC last year that tribes now had access to a ""cache of bullets"". In Sunday's attack, RPNGC Superintendent George Kakas said tribesmen had access to M16s, AR15s, and self-loading rifles as well as pump action shotguns. Police say officers were almost killed as they tried to recover bodies and restore some order. Authorities also believe most of the men who were killed were acting as ""hired gunmen"" from other clans in Enga and neighbouring provinces. Police Commissioner David Manning has told the ABC the massacre was only made possible through the use ""of many, many small arms"". James Komengi is a peace advocate who has been working in nearby Hela province for several decades, bringing communities together to resolve tribal conflicts. ""The tribal fighting will always exist. But the massive destruction and loss of life … has been inflicted in communities because of the use of high-powered weapons,"" Mr Komengi told the ABC. ""The government needs to find out where the high-powered weapons are coming from and where the ammunition supplies are, and they should map out the areas where the guns are and come up with strategies to destroy, reclaim or eliminate these guns. ""Tribal fighting is traditional. Our fathers have controlled tribal violence. But the guns are modern technology. Government has a duty to control the guns."" One man in Birip, close to the scene of the massacre, told the ABC many of the young men who went to fight thought they'd come back alive. He didn't want to be named for his own safety. ""While a lot of people were killed in this attack, this is Enga they will continue these tribal fights. ""The government should have intervened a long time ago. But they are not doing anything and people are being killed like pigs and dogs."" In the wake of Sunday's massacre, Commissioner Manning said legislation would be introduced to parliament to give police greater powers, to ""prevent acts of domestic terrorism"". ""These personnel have clear instructions that are to use any level of force required to prevent further violence and payback,"" he said. ""This includes the use of up to deadly force when the lives of civilians or security personnel are threatened."" But even when they are allowed to use deadly force, police are understandably hesitant to stop active tribal fights. One senior police officer said police weren't ""superman"", and wouldn't ""stand between warring tribes when high-powered firearms are being used"". Mr Komengi believes police have become ""a reactive force"", unable to control the violence. ""They have realised that they are overpowered because the weapons that fighting factions have are beyond what police have,"" he said. ""The best they do now is arrive at the battlefields and collect dead bodies."" Superintendent Kakas said police had so far ""exhausted all avenues"" in their bid to bring the violence to an end. He said when police had attempted mediation through local engagement with communities, ""the people simply don't listen to us and start off fighting again"". Superintendent Kakas also said police had been frustrated in their efforts to track down the leaders providing weapons, money and resources to the tribesmen in Enga. ""From what you've seen in social media … it's the little people fighting in the villages, but with high-powered guns and with bullets. Where are those coming from?"" he said. ""Those are coming from these people we're talking about. ""We know them, we know their names. But we need evidence to pinpoint them and lock them up."" Miki Kaeok, who represents Wapenamanda in the national parliament, released a statement yesterday calling for a state of emergency to stem the violence in Enga. Mr Kaeok said immediate intervention was needed to end the fighting, and echoed the view of police that it had been enabled by community leaders from warring factions using gunmen for hire from other parts of the province. ""Businessmen, leaders and educated elites are supplying guns, bullets and financing the engagement of gunmen. They must be identified and their business accounts thoroughly checked to substantiate their direct involvement,"" he said. Enga Governor Sir Peter Ipatas believes that police could have been doing more in the region, particularly following the deadly violence last year. ""From a provincial perspective, we knew this fight was going to be on and we [alerted] the security forces last week to make sure they took appropriate action to ensure this didn't occur,"" he said. ""Unfortunately the security forces were complacent and we have this very, very high number of deaths. ""The police and security forces must take ownership and be on the ground, assess the situation and take appropriate action. ""I think they have not been proactive and as a result, this fight has been ongoing since last year."" The fresh wave of violence has again renewed calls by some in PNG for immediate Australian assistance on the ground in the highlands. The use of foreign police to carry out active police duties was found to be unconstitutional by PNG's Supreme Court almost 20 years ago. And while Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said Australia would be willing to provide help, PNG's Prime Minister James Marape said his country wouldn't be seeking direct assistance. “Not at this stage but we're working … there's a special police unit to be trained here locally as well as additional training in in Australia,"" Mr Marape said. Mr Komengi described the current situation in Enga as ""a case of ignorance and complacency"" by the government agencies trying to intervene. ""We have allowed this to continue for such a long time that violence has just flared beyond a point where … negotiations can happen,"" he said. ""One of the root causes of all the conflict we have is poverty. People who are needing resources to live a good life … take on the opportunities. ""We are waiting until conflicts have hit the peak destruction and lives are lost."" Sinclair Dinnen, an associate professor in Pacific affairs at the Australian National University, said the recent escalation in violence suggested existing strategies were failing to contain the conflict. ""It's clearly escalating, which is indicative that attempts to settle it down — whether by state intervention or through local means — have yet to succeed,"" he told ABC News. ""The more killings there are, the more further killings that is likely to lead to … until intervention breaks the circuit. ""One of the conventional attempts is to go in with the police … but that's a bit like trying to put a lid on a boiling pot without addressing the heat, the underlying issues."" Mr Komengi is also critical of the response which has prioritised policing over local solutions, and wants authorities to focus on existing programs that have already proven successful. ""Local issues have local solutions. We need to manage the anger. We need to be able to equip people with skills to sit down face to face and resolve the issues,"" he said. ""We have effective programs in Hela province that have managed to resolve difficult conflicts — tribal fights that cost so many lives, have been ongoing for so many years … that even a state of emergency couldn't settle. ""We have transformed those armed men who were killing people, they came face to face and today they are peace lovers. ""We understand our own cultures. Tribal fighting happens using high-powered guns. But when they want to make peace, they'll go back to the traditional methods. ""So why don't we handle it in the first place using our traditional methods instead of wasting money on operating an expensive military and police exercise?""",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-20/high-powered-weapons-in-png-fuel-tribal-violence/103483186
ts99,"Every NRL season brings a fresh crop of rookies and aspiring Canberra fullback Chevy Stewart could well be one of the very best of them. Stewart has been one of the most highly touted juniors in the sport in recent years and after getting a taste of the big time in the Raiders' trial win over Parramatta last week he has the custodian spot for the round one clash with Newcastle firmly in his crosshairs. ""I needed that first hit-out. I haven't had an opportunity in a trial [before] and haven't had my NRL debut so that's definitely a confidence booster,"" Stewart said. ""I'm pretty keen to get that number one spot."" Raiders coach Ricky Stuart isn't short of options at fullback – Jordan Rapana and Seb Kris both spent time there last year and Xavier Savage had a fine season at the back in 2022. But Stewart, a New South Wales Under 19s representative, is doing whatever he can to give himself every chance of winning the spot and he comes into the season with a robust confidence after a summer working under Stuart. ""You can do things wrong a million times and he'll still give you that chance, he'll give you that confidence. For me, that's really comforting,"" Stewart said. ""I like that he picks up us younger lads, gives us a shot even if we're down and not up that day he'll be into us. ""He doesn't sugar-coat anything, so if you're doing something wrong he'll tell you. If you're doing something good, he'll also tell you. He's a pretty straightforward guy."" The 18-year-old's size could be of some concern but he's used to growing up fast. This time last year he was playing SG Ball (Under 18s) before progressing to the NSW Cup where his speed, passing abilities and support play stood out enough for him to be on the verge of the next step. ""I think having a bit more maturity in decision-making and stuff, getting out of that SG Ball phase, getting out of that Harold Matts, underage footy — just maturing, knowing when to play my hand and when not to play my hand — I think that's the biggest thing for me,"" Stewart said. ""I love running. I love running fast, so maybe some speed [is my biggest strength]."" Jeral Skelton — Canterbury Bulldogs A former Australian sevens representative, Jeral Skelton joined Canterbury from the Melbourne Rebels last season and played three first-grade matches, scoring one try. He's still learning the ropes at the elite level of the sport but it's clear there's plenty here for Bulldogs coach Cameron Ciraldo to work with. Skelton is a damaging, tackle-breaking runner with a great appetite for work out of the backfield. ""I try and front-load my carries. That's what they want me to do,"" Skelton said. ""Cirro (Ciraldo) knows my main strength is my attack but my defence is what I've been working hard on. ""I'm trying to bring it up to the standard the rest of the boys are at. ""My goal is to play as many games as possible. To start off with the switch to league was tough, but with my position on the field I just need to run hard. That always makes it easier."" Skelton performed well in the trial win over Melbourne last week, scoring a try, running for 159 metres and breaking eight tackles. He still faces an uphill battle to crack a Canterbury back line which boasts the likes of Josh Addo-Carr, Stephen Crichton and Jacob Kiraz but he should be right in the mix should injuries strike. Tyrone Munro – South Sydney Rabbitohs The Rabbitohs are well known for their sparkling back line but they've struggled to find a consistent starter on the right wing. Tyrone Munro, a 19-year-old local junior, could be the answer with his killer turn of speed and excellent finishing abilities. Munro played three NRL matches last year but will have grown considerably over the summer. He scored the winning try in South Sydney's reserve grade grand final win last year before backing it up with a hat-trick in the State Championship. There might still be some rough edges on his game that need ironing out but he has tremendous upside and could make a razor-sharp Rabbitohs back line even more potent.  Ben Te Kura – Brisbane Broncos The latest from a fine production line of young Brisbane forwards, what sets Ben Te Kura apart is his size. At 205 centimetres, he's one the tallest players ever to come through rugby league – taller than Melbourne giant Nelson Asofa-Solomona, not to mention Philadelphia Eagles offensive lineman Jordan Mailata and Wallabies captain Will Skelton. Size and power are great assets but without the mobility and acceleration to use them they can be as much of a hindrance as a help. However, Te Kura showed enough in Brisbane's trial against North Queensland to suggest he'll be able to use his bulk to make an impact for the Broncos this season. A spot on the bench looms for the 20-year-old in the season opener in Las Vegas. Ali Leiataua – New Zealand Warriors Ali Leiataua has the full range of attributes any side would want in an upcoming centre. At 188cm and 102 kilograms, he's big enough to bump off a defender while also being quick enough to leave them behind and skilful enough to create opportunities for his winger. The 21-year-old played one NRL match last season. However, he has plenty more in his future. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck will have one centre spot to start the season while Rocco Berry and Adam Pompey compete for the other. But don't be surprised if the pride of the Papatoetoe Panthers has the other by year's end.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-20/nrl-rookies-chevy-stewart-ben-te-kura-tyrone-munro/103488646
ts100,"Tensions are increasing in WA's surfing heartland as locals complain of an increasing tide of illegal campers. With a shortage of housing stock, backpackers are being forced to camp wherever they can including in the bush, on the beach, and in car parks. Margaret River resident Michael Willcox said many backpackers were doing the right thing, but others had been disrespectful. ""We've got a constant stream of faeces, toilet paper, wet wipes littering the car parks and in the bushes close by,"" he said. ""And our public amenity blocks are getting used as showers to soap yourself down and your dishes at the same time and continually blocking up our amenities."" The tension between residents and backpackers reached a tipping point on Saturday morning when the Augusta-Margaret River Shire rangers fined a group of teenagers who were camping at the Gracetown Hall. The teenagers' parents had booked the hall for the year 12 ball afterparty and the students wanted to do the right thing and not drink and drive home. Shire president Julia Meldrum said there was a miscommunication as the ranger did not realise a booking had been made. As a result, the fines were reversed. Illegal camping has become a big issue for Margaret River and, according to the shire president, the rangers were doing the best they could. ""We do have quite a serious illegal camping situation in our shire,"" Ms Meldrum said. ""Our rangers do a great job at covering the vast area that they need to cover in our shire. ""The shire extends from Augusta all the way north to Cowaramup and right out to Scott River and the Nannup border. ""And I congratulate them; they're under a lot of stress."" Ms Meldrum said it was a complex issue that the local government could not solve on its own, but ultimately there needed to be more housing. ""In short, we need housing and it's going to take a while,"" she said. Former Tourism WA CEO and Margaret River resident Richard Muirhead said the local government needed more power to penalise people who ""continually abuse these privileges"". ""When you go to the beach, and there's toilet paper everywhere, or rubbish, or faeces or whatever, it's not a pleasant experience,"" he said. ""And these are beaches that are touted as being the best in the world."" Mr Muirhead said rangers should be given the ability to stop people from being in an illegal spot for more than 12 hours. ""There has to be the ability for people to say, stop, you can't park here for 12 hours a day or 12 hours at night,"" he said. ""That's not on, and you can't set up camping gear here … there are free camps that you can do that in, there are national parks you can go to but you can't do it in these really primo beach places, surf breaks and, and parks and the like."" A state government spokesperson said enforcement of illegal camping was a matter for the Augusta-Margaret River Shire.",text summarization,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-20/margaret-river-illegal-camping-tensions-rising/103485964
