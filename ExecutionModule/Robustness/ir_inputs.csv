ir1,"Alan Joyce will leave Qantas tomorrow after a tumultuous week for the airline. Qantas announced his early departure saying Mr Joyce would bring forward his retirement by two months to help the company ""accelerate its renewal"". ""In the last few weeks, the focus on Qantas and events of the past make it clear to me that the company needs to move ahead with its renewal as a priority,"" Mr Joyce said in a statement. ""The best thing I can do under these circumstances is to bring forward my retirementÂ and hand over to Vanessa and the new management team now, knowing they will do an excellent job."" TheÂ news of Mr Joyce's abruptÂ departure comes less that a week after the competition regulator launched legal action against Qantas for allegedly selling tickets to flights that had already been cancelled over a three-month period in 2022. Qantas said it was taking those accusations seriously. The airline's current chief financial officer,Â Vanessa Hudson, will assume the role of managing director and group chief executive effective September 6, and is the first female CEO in the airline's 103-year history. She was scheduled to take over from Mr Joyce in November after being appointed in May. Mr Joyce has spent 15 years as the airline's CEO, and extended his tenure at the request of the Qantas board to assist with its recovery from the pandemic. Mr Joyce said there was a lot of he wasÂ ""proud"" of over his 22 years at Qantas, including the past 15 years as chief executive. ""There have been many ups and downs, and there is clearly much work still to be done, especially to make sure we always deliver for our customers,"" he said. ""But I leave knowing that the company is fundamentally strong and has a bright future."" Qantas chairman Richard Goyder thanked MrÂ Joyce for his service, saying his decision to bring forward his retirement showed he was putting the company first. He said Qantas now faced the task of winning back the public's confidence. ""This transition comes at what is obviously a challenging time for Qantas and its people,"" he said. ""We have an important job to do in restoring the public's confidence in the kind of company we are, and that's what the board is focused on, and what the management under Vanessa's leadership will do."" On Monday, Qantas' board of directors issued a statement in response to the ACCC action, where they apologisedÂ for falling short of expectations after the pandemic. The board also acknowledged Qantas' reputation ""has already been hit hard on several fronts"" and was taking the community's frustration and disappointment seriously. ""We know that the only way to fix it is by delivering consistently,"" the statement said. ""We know it will take time to repair. And we are absolutely determined to do that."" The national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Michael Kaine, said the news of Mr Joyce's departure from Qantas was ""the first good decision the Qantas board has made for a very long time"". Mr Kaine said Mr Joyce needs to have his millions of dollars worth of bonuses stripped ""immediately"". ""Alan Joyce is slipping into retirement two months early with a $24 million pay packet, leaving one of the biggest messes in corporate Australia's history in his wake,"" he said. ""After finally receiving the public scrutiny he deserves for trashing one of Australia's most cherished companies, Alan Joyce is exiting with a $10 million bonus, announced on Friday. ""He must be stripped of those bonuses immediately."" Had Mr Joyce stayed as Qantas CEO until November, he would have accumulatedÂ about $125 million during his time in the job.Â  It is unclear what will happen with his entitlements now he has stepped down. Mr Kaine said that in the wake of Qantas' record pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion last month, on top of $2.7 billion worth of taxpayer funding the airline received during the pandemic, and past actions of grounding of the fleet and illegal outsourcing of jobs, the company needed to refocus and chart a new path forward. ""The question now should turn to whether the board should spill their positions following years of decimated jobs and standards, illegal outsourcing, and outrageous bonuses,"" he said. ""The new regime must embark on a total reset. Qantas needs to bring back good, secure jobs and quality standards."" The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has also welcomed Mr Joyce's decision to leave the airline earlier than scheduled, and said Qantas has an opportunity to start fresh. ""Whilst we welcome Alan Joyce's exit, what really needs to go is the culture of profit over people,"" ACTU president Michele O'Neil said. ""Now is the opportunity for Qantas to restore its reputation as the nation's flagship carrier by working with unions to pay workers the fair wages and conditions they deserve and restore customers' faith in this airline."" In the past fortnight, Qantas has been involved in a number of controversies. On Monday last week,Â the airline admitted it had not disclosedÂ the true value of its unredeemed flight credits,Â during a fiery Senate committee hearing in Melbourne. Qantas had publicly said itÂ hadÂ $370 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, but senators were told during the hearingÂ that Jetstar had another $100 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, and Qantas' international passengers had more flight credits owed to them too. The airline's executives also told senators that they'd set a deadline of December 31 for millions of dollars worth of outstanding flight credits to be claimed. But after aÂ public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of thisÂ year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened."" That same morning,Â Australia's competition regulator accused Qantas of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights that the airline had already cancelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and thatÂ it soldÂ tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy. He told ABC's 7.30 that the best way for Qantas to repay the money was by earning higher profits, therefore paying more corporate tax, and the airline would pay corporate tax again in the 2025 financial year.

ir2,"The three brothers who own Whakaari White Island have had charges against them dismissed in an Auckland court. James, Andrew and Peter Buttle were charged under New Zealandâ€™s workplace health and safety laws with failing to adequately understand and manage the risks of allowing tours on the island. Worksafe NZ argued the brothers, as directors of their company Whakaari Management Limited (WML), failed to ensure an expert risk assessment was conducted prior to the December 2019 eruption, which killed 22 people, including 17 Australians. Their defence lawyerÂ James CairneyÂ argued the prosecution had not done enough to prove the charge against each individual. Judge Evangelos Thomas agreed, saying: ""There is no evidence in this case as to what happened behind the boardroom door at WML. Without that evidence I cannot assess what a reasonable director would have done."" Worksafe NZ concluded its prosecution last week, before the Buttles lodged an application to have charges against the individual brothers dismissed. Today, that application was granted. While charges against the individuals have been dismissed, the trial over their company WML's involvement continues. Thirteen parties were charged as part of this case, including the three Buttle brothers, their company WML, the tour operator White Island Tours, several other tourism companies as well as New Zealand's volcano monitor GNS Science and National Emergency Management Agency. The Buttles and WML pleaded not guilty, as did two other tourism companiesÂ â€” ID Tours NZ and Tauranga Tourism Services â€” that are also on trial.Â  The court is due to hear applications from ID Tours NZ and Tauranga Tourism Services to have charges against them dismissed tomorrow.Â  Five other parties, including tour operators, have pleaded guilty and are yet to be sentenced.Â The National Emergency Management Agency pleaded not guilty before applying to have charges against it dismissed and was successful.Â  The Buttle brothers' lawyer Mr Cairney has repeatedly argued throughout his cross-examination of prosecution witnessesÂ that the duty under the workplace health and safety act does not fall to the owners of the land, but the operators of the tours.Â  He said he was not conceding his clients had a duty under the act, but even if they did, the prosecution had not provided evidence they failed in that duty, nor had they provided evidence on the circumstances of the brothers' individualÂ roles as directors of WML. ""They are not a group, this is not a prosecution of a family,"" Mr Cairney told the court last week. ""This is three individual prosecutions of three named defendants."" Worksafe NZ opposed the application to have the charges dismissed. Lawyer Michael Hodge said last week while the court would need to consider the evidence against each defendant separately, there was ""significant overlap in respect of the allegations and evidence against each Buttle"". He said whether or not there were assigned roles within WML, all three brothers, as directors of the company, had a duty to ensure the risk assessment was done.Â  ""If they tasked someone else to do it, or they tasked one of the three to do it, fine, but at the end of the day, all three were responsible for ensuring that it was done,"" Mr Hodge told the court. He said the evidence presented to the court showed that had not happened.Â",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/brothers-who-own-whakaari-white-island-have-charges-dismissed-/102814996

ir4,"Belated it may be but Alan Joyce's fall from grace is something to behold.Â  For 15 years, he has courted power and cultivated influence, becomingÂ one of the highest-paid executives in the land, all as Qantas operations have suffered and its reputation has been trashed. Suddenly, the never-ending spin that often ran counter to reality and truth has unravelled, leaving the diminutive corporate pugilist alone and increasingly isolated. Rather than a fond farewell, Joyce is facing an ignominious end. Qantas has hit the ejector button without a parachute before his scheduled November departure. It is a course of action the board had to consider. For as events in recent years at National Australia Bank, Westpac and Rio Tinto have shown, directors slow to act end up being shown the door themselves. Qantas is now fighting court action on three fronts:Â from his workforce, his customers and a federal government agency. The only group backing him are investors, who have been on the receiving end of a vast flood of cash, courtesy of ultra-high airfares and taxpayer funds. But even they are growing nervous. Hailed by some in the business community for taking on the unions, it is worth remembering the airline's actions have been declared illegal in court, a decision endorsed on appeal. Not one to shrink from a fight, Qantas now has taken the matter of its illegal sackings to the HighÂ Court. Then there is a class action from thousands of irate consumers, stunned by what they claim is the airline's strategy to appropriate more than half a billion dollars from cancelled flights and book it as profit. That rapidly spreading incendiary was given an almighty leg up late last week by the competition regulator which launched its own legal action, accusing Qantas of selling tickets on more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled, some of them up to 47 days earlier. If successful, and the evidence appears compelling, Qantas could be up for huge fines. It was the aeronautical equivalent of revelations from the banking royal commission, where some of our biggest financial institutions were caught selling life insurance to dead people. The stench had already begun to spread. Rather than take control of the situation, immediately remove Joyce from the company and suspend any further payments to him, the Qantas board, led by Richard Goyder, stood firmly behind its embattled chief executive even as the situation deteriorated. And deteriorate it did. In a startling turn of events, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also revealed that Qantas had concealed the number of flight cancellations to federal government authorities since it relaunched. Rather than the 4,149 cancellations it had owned up to, there were in fact almost three times that number, with the ACCC discovering more than 15,000. Disturbingly, it appears Qantas executives were being paid bonuses linked to diminishing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even jolt the normally lethargic corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, into action. But amidÂ all the scandal, backflips, controversy, apologies and admissions the airline's reputation had been ""tarnished"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to dish out more than $10 million in bonuses to Joyce. For years, Joyce has proclaimed that he didn't take any bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were confined to the tarmac and workers in their tens of thousands were laid off. That's true, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed scrapped. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""retention payment"" which was pretty much the same as his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses weren't scrapped at all. Instead, they were deferred, pushed back into a later time frame. Which is now. This was all done with board approval. As was Joyce's recent decision to sell $17 million worth of Qantas shares at a time he knew the ACCC was investigating its flight credit debacle. The pain now is rippling through the ranks of investors. After the debacle a decade ago, when Joyce shut down Qantas in a showdown with the airline's unions, and a follow-up disaster two years later when the carrier lost $2.8 billion trying to beat Virgin into submission, he reasoned that while you can alienate your customers and staff without too many repercussions, it's never wise to upset the owners. But there are limits. Shareholders have been happy to take the cash that has been rolled back to them via share buybacks and, right now, are on the receiving end of another $500 million buyback. That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Buybacks not only are tax effective but they have the added attraction of pushing up the share price. If you are an executive with a bonus based on share-price performance, it's an even sweeter deal. Not only are your accumulated share allocations worth even more, you'll be entitled to more shares for hitting your targets. Ordinarily, with Qantas standing in the market holding a $500 million buy order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards the heavens. But the daily avalanche of awful news accompanied by convoluted explanations, conflicting statements and ongoing concealmentsÂ has seen investors head for the exits. Despite the buyback announced less than a fortnight ago, Qantas shares have been in freefall, down 15 per cent in the past week, plunging to theirÂ lowest level in almost a year. In a company that hasn't managed to break even during his 15-year stint in the boss's seat, Alan Joyce has done a remarkable job on the executive pay scale. It's unclear what will happen with his entitlements now that he's stepped down. If he had made it until November, and he kept all his entitlements, he was set to end up accumulating about $125 million for himself.Â Â  But what will he leave behind? The ACCC's court action, if successful, could incur fines north of $250 million. Westpac paid a $920 million fine over breaching money-laundering laws, and CBA was forced to shell out $700 million for failing to meet transaction disclosure requirements. Courts and regulators these days aren't prepared to tolerate corporate malfeasance. Then there is the bill for replacing the ageing fleet, now one of the oldest of all major airlines after Joyce continually delayed the purchase of new jets. With a potential $15 billion price tag, that is going to drain Qantas' cash flow for years to come. Joyce's hand-picked successor, Vanessa Hudson, may well have been delivered the ultimate hospital pass. But the biggest cost of all could be the loss of respect and influence in Canberra. The Morrison government forked out $2.7 billion in taxpayer cash to Qantas with no strings attached. Half of that has been pumped straight back to shareholders, including the executives. And now the Albanese government is under fire for its cosy relationship with Qantas after it admitted it blocked Qatar Airways from running extra flights just so it could protect the airline in a deal that screws over consumers and pushes up inflation. The Flying Kangaroo has always punched well above its weight when it comes to lobbying. Almost every pollie in the nation sports a Chairman's Lounge ticket which, incidentally, are selected personally by Joyce. That suddenly is looking less like a badge of honour and more like an item of scorn.

ir5,"A breakthrough in the cold case murder of a man in central Queensland almost 15 years ago has detectives hopeful the ""offenders can be brought to justice"", as his son appeals for help to find his father's killer. Francis Patrick Foley was last seen at Rubyvale, west of Rockhampton in the Gemfields areaÂ in December 2008, and was the caretaker of aÂ non-commissioned lease of remote fossicking land. Neighbours reported hearing gunshots around the time of his disappearance, but previous searches by police in 2010 did not yield any clues. Human remains located by a fossicker in July, 2022 at Sheep Station Creek â€” around 1 kilometre from Mr Foley's residence â€” have since been linked to his close-living relatives through DNA testing, and police will conduct a forensic search at the site today. ""We do believe that with public assistance, irrespective of the passage of time, this crime can be solved, offenders can be brought to justice and we can provide some closure to Frank's family and friends,""Â Detective Senior Sergeant Tara Kentwell said. A $500,000 reward for information that leads to the apprehension and conviction of those responsible for Mr Foley's murder has been offered by the Queensland government. Detective Senior SergeantÂ KentwellÂ saidÂ Mr Foley was last seen on December 23, 2008, when he travelled to Emerald with a neighbour to do some Christmas shopping, before returning home. He was reported missing five days later, when a neighbour went to check on him after localised flooding and foundÂ an exploded gas bottle and Mr Foley's discarded wallet in the carport. ""Blood located at the scene was later identified as belonging to Frank,"" said Ms Kentwell, adding that damage to the gas bottle and Mr Foley's home wereÂ ""consistent with having been hit by a gunshot blast"". ""Neighbours recall hearing gunshots in the direction of Frank's residence during the afternoon and into the evening of the 23rd or the 24th of December, 2008."" In a brief statement, Mr Foley's adult son, Shaun Charlton, appealed to the people of Rubyvale for assistance. ""I have missed my dad now for 15 years,"" he said.

ir6,"Australia's medical regulator says it is cracking down on cosmetic procedures such as botox and fillers, but those living with the long-term impacts of botched procedures say the focus has come too late. The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and the Medical Board of Australia say they will focus on stronger safeguards to protect people from botched procedures by reviewing the level ofÂ care patients receive before and after treatment, as well as ensuring there is informed consent before undergoing treatment. They will propose new procedural and advertising guidelines after receiving a number ofÂ complaints which have includedÂ significant burns, adverse reactions and serious infections.Â  ""The cosmetics sector is a booming sector, and we want to make sure that anyone choosing to undergo a cosmetic procedure is as safe as possible,"" AHPRA's chief executive Martin Fletcher told the ABC. Angie, who did not want her real name published, said she was forced to take a year off work as a nurse after getting routine dermal fillers to correct bags under her eyes. She knew something did not feel right after her treatment at a South Australian cosmetic clinic. ""I went back and said to them, 'This isn't right, I need to get this stuff out of my face.' I was beside myself and couldn't function,"" she said. However, complaints about tightness around her face wereÂ dismissed by the clinic and she was told to wait for things to ""settle down"". Source: AHPRA. All names are pseudonyms Angie ended up back inÂ the clinic forÂ hyaluronidase injections around her eyes to dissolve the fillers. The treatment to fix the problemÂ was intolerable, she said, and led to ""excruciating nerve pain"".Â  She also said the shame of what happened to her prevented her from reporting the clinic at the time, and she eventually went to see specialists who gave her steroids, anti-seizure drugs for nerve pain and analgesics. She said at the very least, there should be better information about what can go wrong with non-surgical procedures, as well as how painful the dissolving agent was to fix the problem. ""They made it look like you're just going there to get your hair done,"" she said. ""It's an ethical and moral issue for people in the field. They need more consent and understanding of the horrific consequences that could happen. ""My self-esteem wasn't OK at that point in time anyway, but then to have this happen, not knowing if the pain will go away, if I'd be able to work and look after my kids again was very stressful. Getting through each day was a trial."" Do you know more about this story? EmailÂ Specialist.Team@abc.net.au. AHPRA and the medical board commissioned an independent review of the regulations around cosmetic surgeons back in November 2021, following a joint ABC-Nine investigation ofÂ the sector. Read the story:Â Videos show 'dangerous' practices in cosmetic surgery clinics, plastic surgeons say. Since then, 14 doctors have been banned or restricted from performing cosmetic surgery in Australia. A cosmetic surgery hotline set up by AHPRA and the medical boardÂ has received 428 calls since its launchÂ this time last year. It also received close to 180 formal complaints, which led to investigations into dozens of doctors. Michael Fraser, co-director of patient advocacy group Operation Redress, said people hadÂ told him they were being upsold a range of procedures while going in for a botox session.Â  ""These doctors will often be more than happy to take your money and sell you procedures,""Â he said. ""If you want to get procedures, get procedures, but you must be able to do so in a safe way. And you mustn't have a doctor trying to upsell you or convince you that you have a problem that you didn't know existed."" He saidÂ anyone who was thinking of getting non-surgical procedures neededÂ to do their research and think about their decision carefully. ""My message would be that you wait three to six months if you're considering getting surgery â€¦ and see how you feel then,"" he said. ""And if you're getting an injectable treatment to ensure that you're going to a place that actually has a fully trained doctor in the clinic. But even then, that really doesn't guarantee you any kind of safety whatsoever."" Mr Fletcher said at-risk Australians suffering from body dysmorphia and other mental health issues needed to be protected. ""It's really important that those [cosmetic procedure] practitioners do good assessments,Â they don't target at-risk people,"" Mr Fletcher said. He said social media advertising would also be a focus. ""We see a lot of advertising that raises concerns for us,"" Mr Fletcher said, pointing the finger at social mediaÂ ads that explainÂ the benefits of cosmetic procedures but not the risks, overstate the benefits, or feature misleading before and after photos. ""We want to really make sure that advertising is accurately and fairly explaining these practices, both in terms of the benefits and risks."" Moving forward, Angie wants all potential clients to get counselling before they can book in a treatment like hers. ""I didn't tell people for so long,"" she said. ""I was so embarrassed, I didn't tell my friends. It's only now that I realise it's happening to other people. They made it out to feel like I was nuts. ""It's their responsibility to let them know this could happen. You can be so wiped out, so unwell, that they won't be able to take them to court."" Angie won't be getting any more cosmetic procedures in the future.Â She said they were not worth it. ""If I didn't have kids I needed to protect, I'd be advocating and putting my face out there,"" she said. ""It breaks my heart that people are going and having these unnecessary treatments.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/ahpra-cosmetic-surgery-probe-to-include-fillers-botox-injections/102811324
ir7,"Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has cast doubt on his government's ability to deliver reforms recommended by the state's Indigenous truth-telling inquiry within the ""ambitious"" time frame set out. The Yoorrook Justice Commission delivered itsÂ reportÂ yesterday after a year-long inquiry, making 46 recommendations for reform that amounted to a major overhaul of the state's child protection and criminal justice systems. The commission is calling on the state government to create an independent watchdog to tackle police complaints, a First Nations-controlled child protection system and to stop detaining children under the age of 16. It set a 12-month time frame for the government to deliver on ""urgent"" recommendations to reformÂ the child protection and criminal justice systems. Mr Andrews saidÂ the government would not respond immediately to the recommendations set out in the report.Â  ""We will look at each and every one of the recommendations that have been made, from this report and the next report,"" he said. ""Cabinet will have a proper, deliberative process to work through line by line, recommendation by recommendation and we will report progress.""Â Â  Mr Andrews described the 12-month time frame for urgent reforms set out in the report as ""challenging"" and would not commit to meeting that deadline. ""But again, being challenged is what this is all about. If this was easy someone else would have done it a hundred years ago."" On Monday, the state opposition acknowledged VictoriaÂ was failing to improveÂ the lives of Indigenous people, but expressed reservations about the creation of separate justice systems for Aboriginal Victorians. During aÂ year-long inquiry, the Yoorrook Justice Commission found evidence of ongoingÂ systemic racism and gross human rights abuses committed against First Peoples in the state of Victoria. Among Yoorrook's recommendations is a call for a new police oversight body â€”Â to be led by someone who is not a police officer â€”Â with the power to arrest and search VictoriaÂ Police officers andÂ investigate police complaints and deaths in custody. Yoorrook wants the new watchdog to have a dedicated First Peoples-led division to deal with police complaints from Aboriginal people. It also called on the government to urgently introduce legislation to raise the minimum age of criminal responsibility to 14 without exceptions and to prohibit the detention of children under 16. The Victorian government has committed to raising the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 12 in 2024, and then 14 by 2027. ""I think all of us can agree, except for the most serious of crimes, sending kids to 'crime school' is not necessarily a smart thing to do,"" Mr AndrewsÂ said. Victoria's Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People, Meena Singh, called on the government to move forward its timeframe for changes. ""It's something that the commission has advocated for on the back of the Our Youth Our Way inquiry that looked at experiences of Aboriginal people and young people and the criminal justice system,"" she told RN. ""So many different people have called for the raising of the age to 14, no exceptions, as soon as possible."" Ms Singh said the punitive approach was not working. ""Children are becoming engaged with the criminal justice system at a very young age without those traumas being addressed and without those behaviours being understood and without any help for them,"" she said. ""We know the earlier a child goes into the criminal justice system the more likely they are to stay entrenched and the more likely they are to progress to adult offending.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/victoria-yoorrook-report-response/102814534
ir8,"Independent senator Lidia Thorpe has revealed her unlikely friendships with political adversaries, and says she was once approached by former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett to run for the Liberal Party. Senator Thorpe, who entered the Senate as a representative of the Greens but now sits on the crossbench, described One NationÂ senator Malcolm Roberts as ""a real gentleman"" and Nationals senator Matt Canavan as ""an old mate from way back"". ""It's weird, it's really weird,"" Senator Thorpe told ABC TV's Kitchen Cabinet. ""I just kind of treat it like the netball court, white line fever. ""Once I'm in that Senate, I'm there for business â€¦ I've got my agenda, which is Black justice in this country. ""And then out of the court, I'll be your friend."" She said Mr Kennett asked her to run for the Liberals, something he confirmed to the ABC. He said he met Senator Thorpe when she was in Victorian parliament and asked if she would consider joining the Liberal Party and standing as a Liberal candidate in future elections. ""I thought she was an interesting character with strong views,"" Mr Kennett said. ""I like people with strong views. That's not to say we always agree on everything. ""In life you want people who are going to challenge you and she certainly does that."" Senator Thorpe told Kitchen Cabinet her response to his offer was: ""You got no hope,"" she said.Â ""Thanks for thinking of me, though. I really appreciate it."" But that friendly rapport does not extend to Opposition Leader Peter Dutton, who Senator Thorpe says she has been unable to meet despite numerous attempts. ""I think he dodges me. I think he's met his match and he just can't deal, you know?"" she said. ""I call out to him all the time 'Hey Dutton!' you know 'come over and have a yarn' and he just walks off. ""[He] doesn't want to know me, which is fine."" She said she did not think her supporters would be shocked by revelations of these unlikely friendships. ""They know how I operate â€¦ I mean I do what I have to do to get the job done,"" Senator Thorpe said. ""And if it means I've got to talk to people that don't have the same values, then that's what you've got to do."" Senator Thorpe was elected to federal parliament for the Greens in 2020 and her parliamentary career since then has been a turbulent one. It has included headline-making moments like calling the Queen a coloniser while being sworn in, and using parliamentary privilege to raise allegations ofÂ inappropriate behaviour in the parliament. Last year, she also admitted to an undisclosed relationship with an ex-bikie president while serving on a law enforcement committee and most recently she left the Greens to sit as an independent over the party's position on the Voice to Parliament referendum. Senator Thorpe saidÂ racism in the school systemÂ drove her to leave school at 14. Then when she entered politics â€“ as the first Indigenous woman to sit in the Victorian parliament â€“Â she felt like the defaultÂ cultural consultant. ""It was cultural overload â€¦ cultural fatigue â€¦ I had toÂ say to people 'I'm not the Aboriginal liaison officer in this place',"" she said. In particular, she said she found dealing with people's ""white guilt"" harder than dealing with racism. ""I've had people cry to me about their white guilt,"" she said. ""They just suck the energy from you, they just want to spend so much time ... to have some kind of an understanding and want to be appreciated for whatever theyâ€™re doing, which makes no difference to our life.""

Energy Minister Penny Sharpe is announcingÂ the government's plans for the future of the power station.

""With the amount of notice given on Eraring's closure, it is reasonable to seek more time,"" the report said. MsÂ Sharpe said she did not want to keep a coal-fired power station open longer than it had to be and would not say how long it should stay open beyond its planned closure date. ""The check-up makes it clear that the case for Origin Energy to extend its time frame for phasing our Eraring is there,"" she said. ""I know everyone wants to put a figure on it but that's not where we are at."" ""I can't give you a time and I can't give you a cost."" She said that would be part of the next stages of negotiating with the power plant. The report makes 54 recommendations about the state's energy transition, with 50 accepted by the government either in full or in part. It does not address how much an extension of Eraring's life will cost taxpayers. In July the Australian Energy Regulator found wholesale electricity prices rose in May due to higher demand in southern states, lower solar generation, and reduced cheap coal capacity in NSW and Queensland. Last week, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) warned of ""reliability gaps"" if Eraring shuts as scheduled in 2025. But that modelling in its ""Electricity Statement of Opportunities"" report only took into account new energy projects in the pipeline. The report also modelled the impact of so-called ""firming infrastructure"" -- that is, battery storage, pumped hydro, and gas â€“ which has been put out to tender but not yet locked in. AEMO found those projects, alongside the Waratah Super Battery, would offset Eraring's retirement, making reliability risks within the acceptable limit. In May, the Minns government commissioned a review of the state's energy transition plan and looked at whether the NSW power supply could manage without Eraring Former energy minister, Matt Kean, claimed it would cost $3 billion to keep the plant open for another two years. Ms Sharpe on Monday called that ""an unverified figure"" and said she had not seen it. She said the cost to taxpayers of keeping Eraring open was not yet being considered. Tim Buckley, from Clean Energy Finance, said providing government subsidies to keep Eraring open could lead to more setbacks for future wind and solar projects. ""Every time you extend a coal plant, you delay and defer expenditure on replacement capacity,"" he told ABC Radio Sydney. ""So these subsidies would be crowding out the replacement capacity that would permanently solve the problem,"" he said. The Climate Council said NSW would not meet its emissions reduction targets if Eraring remainedÂ open beyond the slated closure date.",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/nsw-eraring-power-station-possible-life-extension/102814540
ir10,"It's about as far removed as you can get from a rockstar's lifestyle. But cats, antiques and Japanese artwork wereÂ Freddie Mercury's happy place, his private photos have revealed. The snaps â€” mainly polaroids from the 1980s â€”Â were part of the legendary Queen frontman's estate, and have been released publicly for the first time since his death in 1991. His photo albums, which comprise 265 pictures, have shone a more personal light on the rockstar's final years at his London mansion Garden Lodge, and abroad. They're set to be sold, along with more than 1,400 of Mercury's possessions, in a series of auctions beginning on Wednesday. David Macdonald, senior director of Sotheby's in London, curated the sale and described the pictures as ""mythology busting"". ""They're very, very biographical, but perhaps not in the way you might expect,"" he said. ""He's sitting in the kitchen with a cat or, you know, there's a photo of a vase, or friends in the garden chatting. It's a different kind of world."" While some believed Mercury lived a wild party lifestyle, Mr Macdonald said ""at Garden Lodge, he was actually more likely to ask guests 'can you please use a coaster'."" When Mercury died from complications due to AIDS, he left his west London sanctuary and everything in it to his friend and one-time fiancee Mary Austin. Mr Macdonald said he didn't think Mercury would have objected to people seeing the pictures, which include Christmas and birthday celebrations. ""There's something very interesting about polaroids because there's such a transient moment in life,"" he said. ""They've been in the darkness for 30 years, actually longer, and to have them out in the light and to share them with people for this moment is quite special."" Ms Austin, 72, has rarely spoken publicly since Mercury's death. Earlier this year, she said it was ""time to put her affairs in order"" and sell the items. ""The collection takes you deeper within the individual and the man I knew,"" Ms Austin told the BBC. The items to be auctioned represent most of what was in Garden Lodge at the time of Mercury's death, and include paintings, his baby grand piano, and original song lyrics to some of Queens biggest hits. ""So much has already been written and discussed about Freddie Mercury in the past 30 years, but perhaps never before have we had the privilege of coming so close to illuminating his personal world, something only known until now by his nearest and dearest,"" Mr Macdonald said. The auction is expected to generate millions of pounds, with some of the proceeds to be donated to charity. The items, including the photographs, have been on exhibition at Sotheby's London headquarters until today â€” what would have been Mercury's 77th birthday.",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/freddie-mercury-private-photo-albums-revealed/102768694
ir11,"An upper house committee into the prevalence of birth trauma in New South Wales has been described as the ""me too of childbirth"" during its first day of hearings in Sydney. The inquiry received a record 4,000 submissions from the public. Submissions were largely individual testimonies from women who detailed a lack of consent, inadequate pain relief and clinical incompetence. ""[The obstetrician] broke my water as he said we have to have this baby today as he didn't have time tomorrow,"" one woman wrote. ""When the doctor started cutting me I could feel everything,"" another woman wrote of her experience. Another said: ""Zero risks were displayed to me â€¦ I was never given the chance to provide informed consent."" The inquiry is examining the prevalence, causes and solutions to rates of birth trauma, which reportedly impact as many as one in three women. University of Western Sydney's ProfessorÂ Hannah DahlenÂ co-authored the survey that determined that figure. The study surveyed more than 8,000 Australian women about their birth experiences in 2019, finding that one in 10 reported obstetric violence. The definition and use of the term obstetric violence was disputed among witnesses but is largely taken to refer to preventable harm in maternity care. ""No means no except apparently in childbirth, and it's time to change that,"" Professor Dahlen told the inquiry on Monday. ""This is the 'me too' of childbirth."" The inquiry heard testimony that women are not being given full information about the dangers and complications that can arise during birth, which limits their ability to give informed consent. ""They're meeting the obstetricians for the first time when their legs are in the air,""Â Dr Jared Watts, president of the Royal College of Australian College of Practitioners (RANZCOG), said. ""They've never met these people before, they're doing things to them they don't understand and we really need to change this to patient-centre care."" He told the inquiry RANZCOG supports improved antenatal education, but added sharing the information with pregnant women is ""hard"". ""You don't want to scare women, because you wouldn't want to have a child if you knew of every complication that could happen,"" he said. Australasian Birth Trauma Association president Amy Dawes disputed his comments in her testimony. ""RANZCOG said we can't inform women about all the dangers associated with birth, [but] we need to stop infantilising women,"" she said. ""Why aren't we talking about this before women are in the birth suite?"" Dr Bashi Kumar-Hazard is the chair of Human Rights in Childbirth and told the inquiry in extreme cases obstetric violence can push women to self-harm. ""The abuse and mistreatment of pregnant women and people in maternity health facilities is a normalised event and it is embedded in culture and practice,"" she told the committee. ""We've had clients and women who've committed or attempted suicide, we've seen women reject their infants."" Each witness agreed that continuity of care, in which a woman has access to the same medical practitioner through pregnancy and birth, significantly reduces rates of birth trauma and should be expanded. Midwifery group practice is available across the state to some women, but NSW Health representatives testified staffing is proving a barrier to expanding the services. ""We have to target this recruitment issue by targeting our rural and regionals as that's where we're trying to attract people to come,"" Deb Wilcox deputy secretary of Health System Strategy with NSW Health told the inquiry. The Nurses and Midwives Union called for private midwives to be given hospital visiting rights to strengthen the practice in the state, and for childcare to be examined as a possible way to improve midwives' ability to participate in odd working hours. NSW Health also issued an apology to women who have experienced birth trauma. ""We are sorry this has been their experience and NSW health commits to listening and learning,"" Ms Wilcox said. The inquiry is expected to run for several months and will move to Wollongong on Thursday.

ir12,"Jack Swindells was just seven months old, left unsupervisedÂ and lying on a mat when he was beaten by a four-year-old child at a Brisbane childcare centre in August 2018. It was Jack's second time attending the centre. ""I was at work and took the call from the daycare â€“ they told me that Jack had been scratched on his head, and it was normal policy for them to call when anything [like that] happens. So I just said, 'OK, no problem',"" saidÂ his mother, Angela Swindells. Later that afternoon, when Ms Swindells went to pick up Jack and his four-year-old sister, she was shocked by the extent of Jack's injuries. ""I was furious. He had black eyes, he'd been hit with a wooden jigsaw puzzle piece that had left an imprint on the back of his head, he had bite marks on his arms, scratches all over his face. So that's what I turned up to see after a phone call saying he had a scratch,"" she says. At pick-up, Ms Swindells claims the staff had insisted to her that an educator was in the room when the incident occurred and itÂ had lasted mere seconds. When Ms Swindells complained to the childcare centre on Brisbane's north side, the centre revealed that the infants had been temporarily left alone in a room with older children, unsupervised. The email said: ""The educator supervising at the time is writing a critical reflection and is extremely remorseful that this took place when she went to change a child's nappy, despite having adequate staff for the amount of children, we must be more mindful of when to carry out other tasks. ""No nappy changes will be carried out when the dynamic of children left in the room may cause an issue, unless an educator is present. We will not underestimate what can happen in a short period of time."" The family is now pursuing legal action against the childcare centre. ""When I took my son to the doctor [they] told me that his injuries wouldn't have happened within seconds, it would have been sustained over several minutes,"" Ms Swindells said. Her lawyerÂ Sharntiesha HoganÂ said their caseload of injuries sustained at childcare centres across Australia was increasing. ""Across the board, we're typically seeing incidents where children are falling from heights. So falling from tables or chairs, incidents where children are falling from play equipment and injuring themselves, and where children being physically attacked by other children,"" Ms Hogan said. ""For example, we have one incident where a child fell from a tree and they've actually broken their back from that. ""And the common factor across all of those incidents really comes back to the lack of supervision."" The latest available data showed that in 2021-22 there were 27,551 confirmed breaches across Australia of the national laws at approved early-childhood education services. It also showed a 10 per cent increase in confirmed breaches over the last five years. The most frequent breaches related to: The Minister for Early Childhood Education, Anne Aly, told 7.30 that the government did not know why that was the case. ""The thing is, we don't know what factors [are] behind those increases,"" Ms Aly said.Â  ""We know that there are more children in care. We know that there are more early childhood education and care providers, which may well be contributing factors to this. ""But we have asked ACECQA (Australian Children's Education andÂ Care Quality Authority) to review childcare safety standards and look into child safety to ensure that the standards that we have continue to maintain that high quality that parents and families expect of the early childhood education and care providers."" Early childcare educators are currently seeking a 25 per centÂ increase in wages, and the United Workers Union is lobbying the government hard on the basis that a lift in wages will alleviate the staffing crisis. Ms Aly said the government would be prepared to listen if and when it was called to negotiate. ""The union is currently undertaking a process through the Fair Work Commission, [and] we have made the commitment that if and when the government is called to the table, we will be at the table ... but I don't want to pre-empt that process,"" Ms Aly said. Ms Aly said the government had a range of initiatives that it believed would alleviate the staffing crisis. ""We have a national workforce strategy that we are implementing, [and] we're looking at, what are the actions that we can bring forward?"" she said.Â  ""At the last budget, we had a $72 million package around professional development in direct response to the conversations and consultations that I had with early childhood educators right across Australia, who told me that access to professional development and paid practicums would greatly increase retention in early childhood education and care."" The union has pointed to the record-high number of ""staff waivers""Â now in place across the country as evidence the system is failing. Australia-wide, 17 per cent of long daycare centres now have at least one staffing waiver in placeÂ which grants centres an exemption to operate despite its staff not having attained the minimum early childhood education qualifications. Ms Aly argued that staffing waivers were only being granted when it was deemed safe to do so. ""[Waivers] are granted in exceptional circumstances to ensure the continuity of access for children in early childhood education and care, and never if safety is deemed to be compromised, or deemed to be a concern,"" she said. Sarah Gardner is the deputy director of the Early Childhood Education team at the United Workers Union and is scathing of the conditions currently faced by educators in the sector. ""They have been holding together a broken system for a really long time, and perhaps the issues that have been there for so long haven't come to light in the way that they are now when the staffing crisis is just so deep that it can't be ignored anymore,"" she said. Professor Susie Garvis from Griffith University's Institute for Educational Research agreed the safety standards had been compromised in Australian childcare settings due to the staffing shortage. ""It is beyond a crisis. And unless something is done, we will not have an early childhood education system in Australia anymore,"" Professor Garvis said. ""Early childhood educators are one of the worst paid professions, but the work that they do is one of the strongest contributions to society."" Professor Garvis said an over-reliance on staffing waivers and agency staff to fill gaps in early childhood education was having untold impacts on the next generation. ""If [a child] has an attached relationship with a permanent carer, they will go up to that educator, they will tell them if they're feeling sad or happy, they will be able to ask for things communicate and engage in meaningful interactions,"" she said.Â  ""How is that actually possible with a person who's only temporary in that setting?"" Regulation of child care is a complex web that runs between state and federal agencies. ACECQAÂ governs the system and sets out the compliance standards that each state government needs to ensure are met. The latest figures from ACECQA show that across Australia 10.9 per cent of childcare operators are not meeting the national quality standards. ABC's 7.30 has identified numerous examples of childcare centres around the country not being re-inspected following serious safety incidents. Ms Gardner says safety incidents are a symptom of a system besieged by an inability to retain and attract workers due to the sector's low wages. ""Educators do whatever they can to keep children safe, they do whatever they can to meet the legal minimum ratios that they have to. But sometimes it's just mathematically impossible for them to do that at the moment,"" Ms Gardner says. ""They are working more overtime than ever before, they are forced to come into work when they're sick, they might call in sick and the director begs them to come in because they can't find the staff and there isn't the support for the service to do what's actually best for the child, which is to say to the parents, 'I'm sorry, you can't bring your child in â€“ we don't have enough staff to meet the legal minimum ratios.' ""And so people are expected in some cases to cut corners, and that's where the risks of children's wellbeing and their safety can come into play.""

ir13,"Recently when I stood at the petrol pump watching the price to fill my tank with unleaded petrol soar above $80, I wondered how much the men who operate the world's oil cartel understand the impact they are having on people's lives. That ""cartel"", as some describe it, is OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries). It was first formed in 1960 in Baghdad, Iraq, as a challenge to Western dominance. Five countries Ñ Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela Ñ restructured the global system of oil production in favour of oil-producing states and away from an oligopoly of dominant Anglo-American oil firms known as the Seven Sisters. They wanted to bring stability to the world oil market by coordinating energy policies and ensuring a fair price for their exported oil. OPEC now has 13 members, led by Saudi Arabia, and they are predominantly based in the Middle East, North and West Africa, and South America. In 2016 when the world was getting worried about America's influence over the oil market, OPEC signed an agreement with 10 other oil-producing countries, including Russia, creating what's called OPEC+. Together, these 23 countries produce about 40 per cent of the world's oil. They meet every month to decide on production targets.
Because OPECÊcan control prices Ñ by cutting production and reducing supply Ð it's been described as a powerful cartel. And it isÊmaking noÊsecret of the fact that it is trying to extend its influence. The weaker Australian dollar is also increasing the price we pay for oil and thereforeÊpetrol. We've seen the price of oil goÊabove $US94 a barrel this week, after a three-week run of gains, and some analysts fear it could reach more than $US100 a barrel in the coming weeks. That will keep the price of unleaded petrol hovering around or above $2 a litre for some weeks yet. There's also optimism about a recovery in demand in China that could further feed demand for crude oil.ÊSaudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Monday defended OPEC+ cuts to oil market supply, saying international energy markets need light-handed regulation to limit volatility. Speaking at the World Petroleum Congress in Calgary, Alta., Prince Abdulaziz said there was ongoing uncertainty about Chinese demand, European growth and central bank action to tackle inflation. But when asked aboutÊChinese demand, Prince Abdulaziz said the situation ""is not bad yet."" The risk is that by ensuring the price of oil (and thereby petrol) continues to spike, this could further feed into inflationary pressures and lead to more interest rate hikes. The Reserve Bank is releasing its minutes on Tuesday explaining why it held off on a rate hike at this month's meeting. And although there's growing consensus that the central bank is near the end of hiking interest rates, theseÊoil uncertainties could present another problem for the RBA board and Australians.",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-19/powerful-cartel-still-controlling-the-world-oil-petrol-prices/102871402
ir14,"Desperate bank customers in financial hardship were ignored by Westpac when they asked for help, according to a new lawsuit. The corporate watchdog ASIC is suing the big four bank in the Federal Court, alleging it breached credit laws by failing to respond to hundreds of people in the legally required time frame. If provenÂ Westpac, Australia's second-largest lender, could face fines in the millions of dollars. ASIC said the customers were struggling financially and unable to meet their repayments because they had serious medical conditions, were caring for family orÂ unable to work. Others were flood victims, recently divorced, or had deaths in the family. Some of the affected customers are quoted in court documents, includingÂ a single mother of two children who receives Centrelink benefits. She said she was experiencing domestic violence and added: ""I am unable to work as I have had my finger nearly amputated â€¦ on my right hand, this led to two surgeries, second due to infection â€¦ Several other factors, has put me in financial hardship. I am currently unable to meetÂ other costs of living."" Another said they were caring for a seriously ill child. ""For the past 2 years my daughter has been suffering with an illness which has resulted in 2 brain surgeries and 2 spinal surgeries and numerous procedures in a hospital 2 hours from home which has caused great strain on my finances."" Some faced serious consequences while they were waiting for Westpac to respond, including being chased for debt collection, ASIC said.Â  Court documents state at least six customers had vehicles and property seized after submitting their application. Do you know more about this story? EmailÂ Specialist.Team@abc.net.au The legal action comes as increasing numbers of Australians struggle with mortgage stress. ""Submitting a hardship notice, which results in a change to the credit contract, can be a lifeline for people experiencing challenging financial circumstances,""Â ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said. ""ASIC has taken this action to highlight the importance of lenders responding to hardship notices within the required time frame to reduce harm to their customers. ""Westpac's failures to respond to these notices compounded their customers' difficult financial circumstances."" According to the lawsuit, Westpac had a serious problem with its online lodging systemÂ between 2015 and 2022. This meant hardship notices submitted by almost 450 people were not sent to a customer assistance team. For more than half of them, 229 customers did not receive a response within 21 days, as required. Over 30 times Westpac then declined hardship applications because the bank claimed customers did not provide enough information to support the application, when ASIC alleges that was not the case. Last month, Westpac posted a net profit of $1.8 billion in the third quarter. In a statement, Westpac said it was considering the matters raised by ASIC and has apologised for the ""technology failure"" which meant it failed the customers. ""This error meant we didn't provide some of our customers with the help they needed. For this, we are deeply sorry,"" WestpacÂ Group chief information officerÂ Scott Collary said. ""While we have assisted some of these customers in subsequent contact, it is not good enough that we missed their initial attempt to get in touch."" The corporate regulator is alleging Westpac failed to investigate and fix the systemic issues in its online hardship process. Banks and other lenders have set obligations under the National Credit Code and the National Credit Act when a customer says they are in financial hardship which requires them to respond within a set time frame and to do so, ""efficiently, honestly and fairly"". It is common when a customer is struggling financially that the bank will agree to allow them to change their repayments and negotiate a payment plan. Stephanie Tonkin, the chief executive of advocacy organisation the Consumer Action Law Centre,Â welcomed the legal action. She said hardship requests needed to be treated seriously because of the dire consequences customers could face. ""When people reach out for help to their bank it's often when they are [at their] most vulnerable, and lenders need to respond swiftly and before things unravelâ€” that's why there is a 21-day time frame for banks to respond to hardship requests,"" she said. ""We hear from callers to our helplines who have been pushed into poverty, with all its devastating impacts, because they haven't received the hardship response they need."" Westpac said it had taken steps to assist affected customers. ""Since we uncovered this issue, we've contacted these customers and completed a remediation program including refunds of fees and interest, debt waivers and payments for non-financial loss, totalling approximately $900,000,"" Mr Collary said. ""We have strengthened our processes and are upgrading our online hardship applications."" Westpac added that between 2015 and 2022 it had received 630,000 applications for hardship assistance. Ms Tonkin said Westpac acknowledging its error was encouraging, but added that ""banks as a sector need to do much more to prioritise help for their customers"". ""This is even more important now in a once-in-a-generation cost of living crisis,"" she said.",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/asic-takes-westpac-to-court-hardship-application-response/102814610
ir15,"A little more than a month from now, the nation will go to the polls to vote on whether to enshrine an Indigenous Voice to Parliament in the constitution. Because this is a referendum, voting willÂ be a little different to a state or federal election.Â  We haven't hadÂ referendums all that often recentlyâ€” in fact, the last time Australia held a referendum was in 1999Â â€” so many of us are unfamiliar with how they work.Â  Here are the basics.Â  Saturday, October 14. Polls will be open from 8am to 6pm, local time.Â  The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is running the referendumÂ â€” it's anÂ independent statutory authority.Â  Along with facilitating elections, the AEC is also tasked with running public awareness programs so people can be well informed about the process. All Australian citizens aged 18 and older.Â  If you'reÂ serving a prison sentence of three years or longer, you're not entitled to vote in the referendum. But you are still required to vote if you're 18 or older, an Australian citizen and one of the following applies to you: It's important to make sure you're enrolled to vote,Â because you don't automatically get added to the electoral roll once you turn 18 â€”Â you have to enrol.Â  The easiest way to do this is online at the AEC enrolment website. And if you're not sure whether you've enrolled or not, you can check your details at the AEC website. Yes, voting is compulsory. Everyone who is on the electoral roll is required to vote.Â  You'll be required toÂ write out either YesÂ or NoÂ in English.Â  The AEC says not to do a tick or a cross on your ballot paper. That's because a cross would be considered an informal vote and won't be counted. However, a tick would be considered a YesÂ vote.Â  This is due toÂ vote saving provisions, which haveÂ been in referendum legislation for more than a century. They makes sureÂ a vote can be counted if the voter doesn't follow the instructions on the paper but their intention is clear. The ruling on ticks and crosses is based on legal advice from 1988Â â€” 35 years agoÂ â€” and updated advice from the Australian government solicitorÂ from earlier this year that says:Â  ""A referendum ballot paper posing only one question marked with a tick should be treated as formal. ""This is because it is equivalent to a ballot paper marked 'Yes'. ""However, a ballot paper posing only one question marked with a cross should be treated as informal because it provides no clear indication of the voter's intention. ""This is because a cross may be used, by itself, variously to denote approval or disapproval."" If, under the savings provisions, the AEC cannot determine the intent behind a vote, it'll be considered an informal vote and won't be counted. There areÂ a few ways, but the most common will be by going to a polling place to voteÂ in person.Â  Polling boothsÂ are usually set up in public places like schools, churches, public halls and public buildingsÂ â€” just like a federal election.Â  The locations haven't been finalised yet, but when they have been, the AEC will update this website so you can find the polling booth nearest to you. Yes, butÂ you'll have to apply for a postal vote. You'll either have to apply to be a General Postal Voter â€” which means you'll beÂ automatically be sent ballot papers for federal elections, by-elections and referendumsÂ â€” or you can apply for a one-off postal vote for a single electoral event. You'reÂ eligible to register as a General Postal Voter if you are already on the electoral roll and you are unable to attend a polling place because you're: You can apply for a single event postal vote if you can't get to a polling place on voting day because you: You'll need to apply for a postal vote by 6pm on Wednesday, October 11. You can apply for a postal vote online at the AEC website, but the AEC says people can't apply for a postal vote yet, because the writ (which is the formal instruction to run the referendum) is yet to beÂ issued byÂ Governor-General David Hurley.Â  Postal votes will have to be completed and witnessed byÂ 6pm on Saturday, October 14. Yes. The AEC's Remote Voter Services teams will travel to remote and very remote areas of Australia to set up polling places on certain days. This will happen in the three weeks before referendum voting day. We don't have the exact schedule for this yet, but the AEC will publish the dates and locations on this remote voting website.Â  Yes, but whether or not you can vote in-person willÂ dependÂ on your facility. AEC mobile polling teams may visit: But that's onlyÂ if the administrator of your facility provides access. Voter services in residential care facilities will begin progressively from Monday, October 2.Â  Your facility's administration will provide you with details ofÂ about mobile polling teams, including the time and date of their visit.Â  If you can'tÂ vote in-person, you can apply for a postal vote or you may be eligible to cast a vote via telephone. Yes. Australian citizens will be able to cast their vote in-person at the majority ofÂ Australian Embassies, Consulates and High Commissions. You can check the AEC's overseas voting locations website to see where your nearest polling place is.Â  If you can't attended one of these places, you're encouraged to apply for a postal vote. Postal voting packs are sent from Australia Â â€” not the nearest embassy or consulate Â â€” so people applying for an overseas postal vote are being told to apply as soon as possible.Â  However, postal vote applications aren't open yet. Only in two circumstances: You'llÂ first have to register to vote over the phone, when you'll be given a registration number and will choose a pin. You'll then make a separate call to cast your vote, quoting only your registration number and pin soÂ the AEC voting assistant will not know your name or address. The phone number for this service has not been published yet.Â Â  No. Australia's electoral laws don't allow for voting over the internet.Â  Yes.

ir16,"Former world number one Daniil Medvedev has takenÂ down Alex de Minaur in four sets to prevent the AustralianÂ 13th seed from making back-to-back quarterfinals at the US Open. De Minaur won the first set in dominant fashion before 2021 champion Medvedev found his best form of the tournament to race to a 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 fourth-round win. Hot and humid conditions saw both players tire and take comfort breaks between sets, with Medvedev fearing at one point that he would not be able to continue. ""At one moment I thought I'm not going to be able to play to the end,"" he said. But the third seed said seeing de Minaur, who is renowned for his fitness and ability to play long matches, also struggling gave him a boost as he clawed his way back into the match before running through the finish line. De Minaur's loss leaves Australia without any players in the men's or women's singles draws, while Medvedev moves into an all-Russian quarterfinal against eighth seed Andrey Rublev. Medvedev held a 4-2 advantage in the head-to-head match-ups going into the match but de Minaur had won the past two clashes â€” a quarterfinal at the Toronto Masters a month ago and a three-set win at theÂ Paris MastersÂ in November. And the recent form held true early in the match at Louis Armstrong Stadium. In a battle between two of the sport's great counter-punchers, de Minaur got to the net to win his first point on serve and did so again later in the game, but it was immediately clear long games and rallies would be the order of the day. His volleying skill gave him the first break point of the match in the following game, but Medvedev got himself out of trouble and held with an ace. At 2-2, de Minaur handed Medvedev just his fifth break of the tournament,Â held serve quickly and broke Medvedev again to reach 5-2, rapidly holding serve to love as his opponent looked resigned to dropping the opening frame. Medvedev, who hadÂ called for the trainer to receive a couple of pulls on an inhaler of some sort at 2-2, left the court for a lengthy comfort break between sets and came out the fresher to start the second. The gritty Russian threatened to get back on the front foot with a break in the fourth game of the set, but de Minaur made it back to deuce and saved three more break points, including one with his first ace of the match, before holding serve with another volley winner. But both his serve and volley betrayed him at an inopportune moment while serving to stay in the second set, sending down his first double fault and missing a forehand at the net to allow Medvedev to break to take it 6-4. De Minaur followed his opponent's lead and left the court in between sets as the clock approached an hour-and-a-half on court. Another double fault helped Medvedev get the first break of the third set to reach 3-1, and he carried on from there, breaking once more en route to a two-sets-to-one lead. But Medvedev's dominance in serving out the set for 6-1, meant de Minaur had the advantage of serving first to start the next frame, meaning he would not have to play from behind when things were on serve. He immediately lost that leg-up in the third game of the set, though, with Medvedev breaking the de Minaur serve to love. Medvedev broke again to reach 4-1 and fought off two break points as he got within a game of the last eight. De Minaur held serve in the next game, but it was the last point he would win as Medvedev closed out the match with a love hold, having won 14 of the last 17 games.",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/alex-de-minaur-daniil-medvedev-us-open-fourth-round/102814508
ir17,"Russia'sÂ Sergei Surovikin, nicknamed ""General Armageddon"", has reportedly been seen in public for the first time since aÂ brief mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group. A photo seemingly of Mr Surovikin was published by aÂ a well-known Russian media personality on Monday.Â  ""General Sergei Surovikin is out. Alive, healthy, at home, with his family, in Moscow. Photo taken today,"" Ksenia Sobchak wrote in a caption to the picture on Telegram. Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the photo, which showed a man in sunglasses and a cap walking alongside a woman resembling Mr Surovikin's wifeÂ Anna. Prominent independent Russian journalist Alexei Venediktov also published a report on his Telegram channel. ""General Surovikin is at home with his family. He is on leave and available to the Defence Ministry,"" Mr Venediktov said.Â  HeÂ provided no pictorial evidence. Various media outlets reported MrÂ Surovikin fellÂ out of favour with the Kremlin following the aborted mutiny by Wagner in June, andÂ reportedÂ he was being investigated for possible complicity. He was removed asÂ air force head and his deputy Viktor AfzalovÂ assumed the job on a temporary basis, according toÂ State news agency RIAÂ last month. Mr SurovikinÂ was briefly in charge of Moscow's war effort in Ukraine before that role was handedÂ to General Valery Gerasimov in January.Â  The late Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died in a private jet crash last month, was fiercely critical of Russia's defence establishment but spoke highly of Mr Surovikin, calling him ""a man who is not afraid of responsibility"". Meanwhile, Ukraine's deputy defence minister has said troops have regained more territory on the eastern front and are advancing their counteroffensive against Russia.Â  Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Kyiv's forces had retaken about 3 square kilometresÂ of land in the past week around the eastern city of Bakhmut, which was captured by Russian troops in May. Ms MaliarÂ also reported unspecified ""success"" in the direction of the villages Novodanylivka and Novoprokopivka in the Zaporizhzhia region.Â  Ukraine has now taken back about 47 square kilometresÂ of territory around Bakhmut since starting its counteroffensive in early June, Ms Maliar wrote on Telegram.Â  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited troopsÂ in the eastern Donetsk region, where Bakhmut is located, and in the Zaporizhzhia region on Monday.Â  MrÂ Zelenskyy presentedÂ medals to soldiersÂ and offeredÂ thanks to medics at a field hospital. Ms Maliar said last week Ukrainian troops had broken through the first line of Russian defences, and Ukraine's military expects now to advance more rapidly.

The Pragyan rover from the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft was ""set into sleep mode"" but with batteries charged and receiver on, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, late on Saturday. ""Hoping for a successful awakening for another set of assignments!"" ISRO said. ""Else, it will forever stay there as India's lunar ambassador."" By landing on the moon, India joined the United States, China and the former Soviet Union. It went beyond them in reaching the rugged south pole, shortly after Russia's Luna-25 crashed on a similar attempt. Chandrayaan-3's soft, textbook touchdown after a failed attempt in 2019 sparked widespread jubilation in the world's most populous country. The media hailed the landing as India's greatest scientific feat. Pragyan travelled over 100 metres, confirming the presence of sulphur, iron, oxygen and other elements on the moon, ISRO said. Now India is hoping for the success of a probe launched on Saturday to study the sun, observing solar winds that can cause disturbance on earth commonly seen as auroras. ""The satellite is healthy"" and in earth orbit, ISRO said on Sunday, as it prepares for its 1.5-million-kilometre journey. The rocket left a trail of smoke and fire as scientists clapped, a live broadcast on the ISROÂ website showed. The broadcast was watched by more than 860,000 viewers, while thousands gathered at a viewing gallery near the launch site to see the lift-off of the Aditya-L1 spacecraft, which is named after the Hindi word for the sun. Scientists hope to learn more about the effect of solar radiation on the thousands of satellites in orbit, a number growing with the success of ventures like the Starlink communications network of Elon Musk's SpaceX. Longer term, data from the mission could help better understand the sun's impact on earth's climate patterns and the origins of solar wind, the stream of particles that flow from the sun through the solar system, ISRO scientists have said.

ir19,"Six Queensland men have been charged with more than 100 child sex offences following extensive investigations by taskforce Argos detectives. Detective Acting Superintendent Glen Donaldson said the alleged offences committed by theÂ menÂ were ""extremely serious, and in some cases truly shocking"". As part of the investigation, a 46-year-old Fortitude Valley man was charged with more than 20 child sex offences and is accused of photographing children in public toilets as well asÂ running a hidden network inside a child exploitation website. A 44-year-old Beerwah man was taken into custody accused of 62 offences, including making child exploitation material. An Upper Kedron man, 42,Â  and a Cairns man, 39, were charged with using a carriage service to access child exploitation material. A 22-year-old Albion man was charged with grooming a child and making exploitation material and police allegeÂ a 26-year-old man from Carina, used social media to attempt to meet a child. All of the men charged are due to face court in the coming weeks. Detective Acting Superintendent Donaldson said the offences involved children as young as infants, toddlers, andÂ up to 17 years old. ""The maximum penalty for some of these offences is 20 years imprisonment,"" he said. ""This is probably every parent's worst nightmare."" Detective Acting Superintendent Donaldson said theÂ 22-year-old Albion manÂ charged with grooming a child and making exploitation material had written down his ""fantasies"". ""This offender discussed the rape of children online and has written down child sex fantasies, which are truly shocking,"" he said. Detective Acting Superintendent Donaldson said the men involved were in well known groups. ""They all know each other so the less information that gets out, the more assistance Argos has in continuing to penetrate these networks,"" he said. ""This is still an active investigation. ""Obviously, these offenders love watching the news to see what Argos is doing so I have to be very careful in what I can say,"" he said. He could not provide information on the men's occupations but said none of them had blue cards. Minister for Child Safety Craig Crawford said the number of alleged offenders arrested was concerning, butÂ he wasÂ more worried about those who hadn't yet been caught. ""It's a reminder to parents to always be consciously aware of where your child is, and who they're interacting with at all times,"" he said. He described the alleged offending byÂ one of the men as ""disgusting"" and a ""shocking act"".Â  ""If you have any concerns at all about the welfare of a young person, you can report it,"" Mr Crawford said. Detective Acting SuperintendentÂ DonaldsonÂ echoed the importance of theÂ roleÂ caregivers played in children's lives. ""These arrests are a reminder to parents and caregivers of the dangers of online predators and how crucial trusted loved ones are in teaching children about privacy, personal safety and that nothing is so awful they can't speak to them about it,"" he said.

ir20,"Backpackers are ""flooding back"" to Australian shores, with the number of holiday visa applicationsÂ returning to pre-pandemic levels, new data suggests.Â  They're integral to Australia's tourism and agriculture industries, but backpacker numbers dropped with travel restrictions during COVID-19.Â  Department of Home Affairs data shows more than 111,000 Working Holiday Maker visa applications were granted between July and December last year â€“ compared to 23,000 in the same period in 2021.Â  Griffith University cultural geographer Kaya Barry said these numbers will likely have risen again in 2023.Â  ""They are flooding through the regions looking for seasonal work, but also in tourism and hospitality,"" Dr Barry said. Even as Australia began to open its borders,Â Dr Barry saidÂ there was still a lot of ""fear"" and ""hesitation"".Â  ""A lot of us thought that backpackers would just hop on a plane and come, but anybody who tried to book an international flight last year remembers how expensive the flights were,"" she said. ""For young people on a backpacking trip, that was quite a big cost."" She said backpackersÂ eager to return last year hadÂ lengthy visa delays. ""It's only really the start of this year and over the last few months that we've really seen an influx of backpackers back to what it was before the pandemic,"" she said.Â  Dr Barry said the new challenge for backpackers will be finding work in Australia. When the borders closed due to the pandemic, Dr Barry said many returned to their home country. ""The numbers of backpackers and other migrant workers really dropped off for farming communities,"" she said.Â  ""Regional QueenslandÂ in particularÂ was hit pretty hard because backpackers do the bulk of horticultural work around harvest time."" It led to many industries finding other ways to source workers. ""A lot of farms moved to using Pacific Islanders, who are onÂ the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility visa scheme,"" Dr Barry said. Dr Barry said it had left a lasting culture shift in farming communities. ""There's not necessarily the same amount of work around for backpackers to do if they want to complete their farm work and get their second- or third-year visa extension,"" she said. ""That might change how long people actually come and stay in Australia."" As well as limitedÂ work available for backpackers, there are also accommodation shortages. Brisbane hostel accommodation manager Thomas, who did not provide his last name, said his hostel has reached 90 per cent capacity and expects it to be even busier over the summer holidays. He said theÂ housing crisis had led to many backpackers staying longer in hostels. ""There's not a lot of accommodation for Australians, let alone backpackers,"" Thomas said. He said there are now also limited hostel options. ""There's not that many hostels now in Brisbane; because of COVID, a lot of them shut down, so there's less accommodation."" But Thomas said backpackers are still ""itching"" to get to Australia, particularly Queensland. ""A lot of the backpackers I am meeting now said they would've come before, but COVID prevented them,"" he said. ""They're happy to be here. We're happy to have them.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/queensland-backpackers-working-holiday-visas-increase/102811616

Rubiales also grabbed his crotch in a lewd victory gesture last month in Sydney. HeÂ has been provisionally suspended by FIFA and is facing a Spanish government case against him for the conduct that prompted a storm of criticism and led to widespread calls for his resignation.

ir23,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is expected to travel to Russia within the month to meet with President Vladimir Putin, according to a US official,Â as the Kremlin tries to acquire military equipment for use in its war in Ukraine. The officialÂ was not authorised to address the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. They said the USÂ was not sure exactly where or when the meeting would take place, but the Pacific port city of Vladivostok would be a likely possibility given its relative proximity to North Korea. In a rare trip abroad, Mr Kim would travel from Pyongyang, probably by armoured trainÂ to meet Mr Putin, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing USÂ and allied sources. While in Vladivostok, a port city not far from North Korea, the two leaders would discuss Mr Kim's sending Russia artillery shells and anti-tank missiles in exchange for Moscow's advanced technology for satellites and nuclear-powered submarines, the newspaper reported. The New York Times reported that Kim could possibly go to Moscow, although that was not certain. MrÂ Kim's father, the reclusive Kim Jong Il who famously shunned planes and travelled by armoured train only, last visited Russia just months before his death in 2011. National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson noted on Monday that Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu travelled to Pyongyang last month and tried to persuade North Korea to sell artillery ammunition to Russia. ""We have information that Kim Jong Un expects these discussions to continue, to include leader-level diplomatic engagement in Russia,""Â Ms Watson said. She added the USÂ is urging North Korea ""to cease its arms negotiations with Russia and abide by the public commitments that Pyongyang has made to not provide or sell arms to Russia"".

ir25,"The Queensland Government should consider compensating two young men with autism found in a locked room at their Brisbane home severely malnourished and naked, the disability royal commission has recommended. This story contains content that readers may find distressing. In a 222-page report into the brothers' case, handed down today, the commission also recommendedÂ the State of Queensland apologise to the siblings, known by the pseudonyms Kaleb and Jonathon, for ""omissions in preventing violence, abuse, neglect and deprivation of their human rights"". After a triple-0 call from a family friend, the siblings, then aged 19 and 17, were found unclothed in a room with the door handles removed in May 2020. Their father, who had a terminal illness, was found dead at the home. At a press conference on Tuesday morning, Child Safety Minister Craig Crawford apologised to the brothers on behalf of the government. ""I want to sincerely apologise to Jonathon and Kaleb for what occurred to them over the 20 years as disclosed by the royal commission,"" he said. ""This should never have happened. ""This should not happen in our country, and it should not happen in our state. ""We must do better, we can do better, and we will do better."" He said the government would consider the report's findings and release its response in ""due course,"" but wanted to deliver an apology to the family first. The commissionÂ recommended an independent reviewÂ be ordered into the brothers' case ""at the earliest opportunity"". It said the review should probe the ""powers and responsibilities or all the departments and agencies that engaged"" with Kaleb, Jonathon and their father. The damning report by the disability royal commission into the boys' case found the State of Queensland could have, and should have, done more to prevent Kaleb and Jonathon from experiencing violence, abuse, neglect, and the deprivation of their human rights. ""When Queensland police attended the home, they observed faeces on the floor of the spare bedroom and main bedroom, Kaleb and Jonathon's bedroom was completely bare with door handles removed and Kaleb and Jonathon were naked,"" the commission found. ""Kaleb and Jonathon were admitted to hospital and treated for severe malnutrition. They remained in hospital for two weeks."" The commission recommended the State ""should acknowledge and apologise"" for the brothers' suffering. DuringÂ hearings into the young men's plight, the commission was told government agencies had extensive involvement with the family, in one case for up to 20 years. Dozens of complaints were made to at least half a dozen Queensland government departments including child safety, education, housing, health, police, and disability. The commission was told that in February 2019, Kaleb, then 18, was seen by child safety officers eating a dog's bone. But Department of Children chief practitioner Meegan Crawford, who reviewed the teenagers' files, said that because Kaleb was an adult at the time, the department was not legally mandated to intervene. As children, Kaleb and Jonathon were removed from their father's care in 2010 for a week but later returned to him. Dr Crawford told the inquiry,Â for the boysÂ to be removed, child safety would have had to take the case before a magistrate, but she believed that would have resulted in the magistrate telling them to work with the father rather than remove them. The Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability heard the brothers' school often bathed them and gave them fresh clothes, that they were observed smelling of faeces, and several times needed haircuts because their hair smelled so strongly of urine it could not be washed out. Jonathan was also observed by teachers to be ""smelling of a strong dog odour"", and ""passing rocks and pebbles"" in bowel movements.Â  In its findings on the siblings' case,Â the commission made five recommendations including calls for better staff training: The teenagers' case was the 33rdÂ and final public hearing of the royal commission, examining the nature and extent of violence, abuse, and neglect experienced by people with a disability, and the failure of natural safeguards and government departments and agencies to prevent such events. The commission is due to hand its final report to Governor-General David Hurley by September 29. Opposition leader David Crisafulli said the case had ""rocked the state"" and ""it was clear those teenagers were failed"".Â  He backed calls for the state to apologise to the brothers. Asked if he would also apologise for any failures or inaction relating to the brothers on the former Newman government's watch, he replied: ""yes"". ""Any child who was failed deserves an apology,"" he said. ""Any family that was let down deserves to know that their leaders commit to doing better and it doesn't matter how far that stretches back, those families and those kids are owed it. ""We have to make sure these failings never happen again and we have to make sure our child safety system is properly resourced, that children don't continue to fall through the cracks, and we have to make sure that the spotlight is put on it â€” no matter how far back it goes â€”Â we have to do better."" *Not their real names",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/qld-disability-royal-commission-abuse-autism-child-safety/102813354
ir26,"Stronger age verification processes are needed on sites used by children to help prevent kids being from coerced into making sexual abuse material, according to the eSafety commissioner. New analysis from the commissioner of more thanÂ 1,300 child sexual abuse material (CSAM) reports showed that one in eight were ""self-generated"", with predators grooming and coercing kids into filming and photographing themselves performing sexually explicit acts. Abusers were messaging children on social media and online gaming platforms, with abusive material then either sent there or via other services such asÂ Skype or FaceTime. While many platforms have different rules for accounts of those under 18, such as not allowing messaging, many kids easily circumvent them by putting in a different age. The commissioner told the ABC these self-declaration measures on social media are too easy to circumvent and must be made stronger. The commissioner's comments cameÂ after the federal government last week told the eSafety commissioner it would not follow herÂ recommendation for a trial of age verification on adult websites. Instead, it said, it would wait until the development of a new industry code to prevent kids accessing legal but age-inappropriate adult content was finalised. To try toÂ get a better idea of how and where children are vulnerable to online abuse, eSafety analysed the URLs of 1,330 instances of such incidents over the past financial year. TwelveÂ per centÂ of the material was found to be ""self-generated"", with children being encouraged and coerced into making sexually explicit videos and images by predators online. ""Traditionally, we've reported and removed material where it's physical contact offending by a perpetrator with a young person,"" eSafety commissioner Julie Inman GrantÂ said. ""But what we're seeing today is young people are being groomed and coerced into sexual acts that are recorded on smart devices, on webcams remotely."" ""Our investigators have seen content where a child is being ordered to remove their clothes and perform acts via a webcam as their parents call them for dinner in the next room."" The commissioner is calling on parents to tell their children early and often that they won't get in trouble for telling their family what is going on. ""Parents need to be involved in their kids' online lives the way we areÂ their everyday lives,"" she said. That includes making sure devices are used in shared parts of the home or spending time with children while they play online. But Ms Inman Grant said while parents hadÂ an important role to play, tech companies were equally responsible for making their products safe for the community. While many platforms restrict what features users can access based on age, it is not hard to just put in an earlier birthdate. ""Self-declaration makes it too easy to lie,"" she said. ""And not only do children prevaricate about their age, but adults can create fake or imposter accounts and pretend to be a child. ""We do need more rigorous age verification, but I'd say verification technologies overall."" Earlier this year the eSafety commissioner handed down recommendations around age verification for online adult content. It included a call for the government to trial age-assurance technologies to prevent children from accessing porn. But the federal government said it was waiting for a new industry code to be developed before making further decisions about age verification on adult content. ""The government made its decision and I need to get on with using the tools that I have to help reach more parents, more children with education information and to make sure that we can get some industry to sign off on some robust codes,"" Ms Inman Grant said. That code is being broken up into twoÂ classes of content.Â ClassÂ one is illegal and class twoÂ is legal but inappropriate for children. The codes are developed by industry, with eSafety registering five of the eight codes submitted to them earlier this year.

ir27,"Tens of thousands of South Korean teachers have held demonstrations to demand better protection of their rights and spotlight what they called widespread harassment by overbearing parents that has reportedly spurred some colleagues to take their lives. After a young teacher was found dead in an apparent suicide in July, complaints by public school teachers have grown sharply over mistreatment by parents and students, such as accusations of child abuse for disciplining pupils. An estimated 50,000 teachers rallied at a protest in Seoul on Monday. ""To inquire is to mourn,"" read some of the banners displayed at the peaceful protest. Legal measures had been inadequate and government officials passive when it came to protecting teachers against problems, said one teacher who participated in the rally, but gave only her surname, Lee, so as to protect her anonymity. ""On top of classes, there have been unnecessarily heavy workloads and excessive complaints from students and parents,"" she added. ""They have been a comprehensive problem, which I experienced throughout my 15 years of teaching."" During the six years to June, about 100 public school teachers have committed suicide in South Korea. Fifty-seven taught at primary schools, government data showed. President Yoon Suk Yeol ordered officials to listen to the teachers' demands and work to protect their rights, his office said. Scores of teachers had vowed to take a leave of absence in protest on Monday, as government and school board officials scrambled to avert major disruptions of classes and promised legal steps to boost protection. Apart from the Seoul protest, about 60,000 to 70,000 teachers held rallies elsewhere, organisers estimated. Authorities warned that collective action by teachers to disrupt classes was illegal and threatened disciplinary steps. The South Korean teachers' union was not involved in Monday's demonstrations, however, said the group leading the protests, Everyone Together As One. ""We will protect them [the teachers]Â and make changes so that not one more teacher chooses to take their life,"" protest organisers said in a statement. In July, a primary school teacher was found dead at school after reportedly expressing anxiety over complaints by a parent regarding a dispute among students. Among the visitors to the memorial for the teacher set up at a primary school in Seoul was Jung Chai-jin, 67. ""They studied hard to go to education schools and became teachers because they loved children,"" she said. ""And they have to die like this in the classroom?"" Ku Bo-na, a fifth-grader from another school who also visited the memorial, said, ""Teachers are those who make me grow, so it will be sad if my teacher passes away."" Teachers have held nationwide vigils and demonstrations each weekend since to mourn the death, culminating in a rally on Saturday that drew as many as 200,000 teachers near the National Assembly in Seoul. South Korea has the highest rate of suicide among developed countries, data from the World Health Organisation and OECD shows, with more than 20 people per 100,000 of its population taking their lives. The education ministry has vowed to prevent incidents of teachers being punished for legitimate educational activity, and to improve communication between teachers and parents. ""The number of indiscriminate child abuse reports has been increasing, as students' rights were overly emphasised, while those of the teachers were not respected,"" it said in a statement. ""We will support teachers so that they can focus on education, free of concerns over getting indiscriminate complaints of child abuse."" The ministry set up a task force on Saturday to strengthen legal measures and take steps to guarantee teachers' rights, such as not taking telephone calls from parents on their personal phones, but did not give a specific time frame.

Junta leaders laterÂ annulled the voteÂ and said it was not credible. West and Central Africa's eighth coup in three years left crowds cheering in the street but drew condemnation from abroad.Â  Central African regional bloc ECCASÂ said on Monday it was suspending Gabon until a return to constitutional order. Mr Nguema was given a standing ovation by officials as he arrived for the ceremony, and again after he was sworn in by a panel of constitutional court judges.

In hisÂ speech, Mr Nguema proposed reforms including a new constitution to be adopted by referendum, new electoral and penal codes, and measures to prioritise local banks and companies for economic development. He also said political exiles would be welcomed back and political prisoners freed. Mr NguemaÂ described the coup, which ended the Bongo family's 56-year hold on power in the oil-producing country, as a moment of national liberation and a manifestation of God's will. ""When the people are crushed by their leaders â€¦ it's the army that gives them back their dignity,"" he said.

One of the victims was a young man who was trapped in a lift that filled up with water, while another was inside a vehicle when it got flooded, police said. The third person who died was a 50-year-old man who had been reported as missing. His body was later found floating in a river near his Camarena home.Â  Roads have been shut and subway and high-speed trainÂ connections have also been affected as a result of the rain, according to authorities.Â  The sudden downpour on Sunday and early Monday transformed streets into muddy riversÂ that swept away cars and trash bins across Madrid, Castile-La Mancha, Catalonia and Valencia regions.

ir32,"The Solomon Islands oppositionÂ is calling for an independent investigation into a contentious shipment of ""replica weapons"" brought into the Pacific Island country by China after publicly released US diplomatic cables claimed the guns were likely real. A controversy erupted in Solomon Islands in March last year after local media reported that firearms had been smuggled into the capital Honiara. The Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) said at the time that the weapons were ""not capable of firing any live munitions"" and that the Chinese embassy had shipped them into the country to help train local officers. But the Solomon Islands opposition and some civil society activists were deeply sceptical of that claim, and rumours around the shipment have continued to swirl over the last 18 months. On Friday last week Al Jazeera reported that US diplomats in Port Moresby cabled back to Washington at the time saying the weapons seemed to be genuine, citing a source who said the ""weapons appeared real in every way, including in weight and mechanics"".Â  The RSIPF held a demonstration showing off the ""replica"" weapons more than a week after the story first broke, but the US diplomatic cable said the guns in the crate were ""not the same"" as the ones publicly displayed. The RSIPF has not yet responded to the claims in the diplomatic missive, but the head of the Solomon Islands Foreign Ministry Collin Beck took to social media over the weekend to call the story false. ""Sad to see divisive geopolitical narrative to tarnish (Solomon Islands') image with article that holds no truth,"" he said on the website X, formerly Twitter. ""Allegation of (Solomon Islands) receiving arms from China is not true and not helpful against today's fast-changing international system."" But the opposition leader in Solomon Islands, Matthew Wale, has lashed the RSIPF and the government, accusing them of ""deception at the very high level"".Â  ""When the very institutions entrusted to protect us are implicated in such deceptive acts, it becomes clear that this government cannot be trusted, especially on matters as critical as national security,"" Mr Wale said in a statement. Prominent opposition MP Peter Kenilorea Jr told the ABC the RSIPF needed to publicly respond to the allegation, and that the government should follow that up by establishing a commission of inquiry into the shipment. ""To have this assessment made by a prominent development partner just begs that question again: Were we told the truth? And in the end the truth is what we want to know,"" he said. ""There needs to be a broader inquiry into this rather than just the word of the Police Commissioner â€¦ to come up independently and verify for us whether yes or no."" Mr Kenilorea Jr said the allegation of weapons smuggling brought back memories of the violence and upheaval which bedevilled Solomon Islands in the lead-up to the RAMSI intervention in 2003, when militants took control of police armouries and seized semi-automatic weapons. ""For us, allegations of real weapons coming in, these are issues which touch the heart of the security of our nation,"" he said. The controversy comes as Australia tries to cement its security ties with Solomon Islands, and ward off China's attempts to establish itself as a key security partner for the Pacific Island country in the wake of the contentious security pact it signed with Beijing last year. China has donated dozens of cars and motorcycles to the RSIPF, as well as two water cannon trucks, while last year Australia handed over more than 60 rifles, along with 13 new police vehicles. Australian police and military personnel led another security intervention into Solomon Islands in late 2021 after Honiara was hit with widespread looting and rioting and Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare called for assistance. Australian police remain in the country under the Solomon Islands Assistance Force and over the weekend the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) confirmed that more personnel would be sent over to help provide security for the Pacific Games in November. DFAT said that Australia had also agreed to extend the presence of the contingent until June next year, to help with elections due in 2024. Mr Sogavare has repeatedly assured Australia that it remains the security ""partner of choice"" for his country but has also warned he will call on China for help if he needs to do so. A spokesperson for DFAT stressed it made the security commitment at the request of the Solomon Islands government, and said Australia was ""proud to be Solomon Islands' primary security partner"".",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-04/solomon-islands-china-replica-guns-likely-real-us-cables-say/102811602
ir33,"When Artist Yanni Pounartzis was designing his chip-loving magpie sculpture to command Canberra's CBD, he never expected it to be recognised as one of Australia'sÂ ""big things"".

And just 18 months after landing in the capital, Big Swoop has been recognised as one of the nation's top 10 big things in a new Royal Australian Mint coin series.Â  ""I'm in disbelief. He [Big Swoop]Â won't go away, and he won't stop receiving attention,"" Pounartzis said. ""It was just an idea, a funny, ironic idea. ""When you release an idea to the community, then they decide what it becomes, so that's been really nice to see where he's ended up.""

ir34,"When Atina Schutz's mum picked her up from school in the Marshall Islands' capital of Majuro, she didn't expectÂ the car ride home to turn frightening. But as they drove, Atina, who was eight or nine years old at the time, looked on helplessly as a particularly high tide gushed from the ocean and over the road. ""It came all the way up to mid-way around our tires, and I remember feeling scared watching all the cars driving through what looked like another sea on the road in Majuro,"" Atina, now in her early 20s, remembers. Rising sea levels mean high tides inundate the low-lying land in Majuro more often than they used to, flooding businesses and eroding the coastline. For coral atolls like Majuro, where the sandy land generally pokes only a metre or two above the waves and is no more than a few hundred metres wide, the sea is a constant presence; a roiling ocean stretching to the distant horizon to one side, and a relatively sedate lagoon on the other. And the sea is central to Marshallese culture and economy. For thousands of years, Marshallese sailors haveÂ criss-crossed the open ocean and lagoons on outrigger canoes, shuttling people and cargo between islands sometimes hundreds of kilometres apart. Even today, most inter-island transport is done by boat. But where traditional sea transport takes place in wooden canoes with sailsÂ woven from pandanus leaves, modern vessels tend to be propelled by diesel-powered motors. And that's a problem. Spills and leaks pollute waters and coastlines. Toxic emissions from burning fuel can contribute to conditions such as asthma and cardiovascular disease in people living near ports. But the Marshall Islands has a plan. It involves marrying traditional engineering with futuristic technology to wean its fleets off diesel altogether. The climate-vulnerable nation has also spent decades urging the rest of the world to kick their addiction to fossil fuels. Especially the global shipping industry, which spews a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. Because without rapid decarbonisation, the very ocean that provides so much to the Marshall Islands might one day render much of their limited land uninhabitable. Atina is one of the latest in a long line of Marshallese people to bring their plight to the world stage. Last year, she addressed a symposium on low- and zero-carbon shipping fuels, run by the International Maritime Organization. ""The economics are clear,"" she said. ""Kicking the can costs more than acting decisively now."" And Atina knows. She's a researcher with the Micronesian Center for Sustainable Transport, which is based in the Marshall Islands' capital, Majuro. The Center provides policy analysis and research on transportation issues in the country and wider region, with a heavy focus on maritime transport. ""So much of our work, in addition to calling all countries to decarbonise rapidly, [is to] provide resourcing for climate-vulnerable regions to be able to deal with the impacts, while the whole world continues on its glacial pace of decarbonisation,"" Atina says as we sit in her office. When it comes to cleaning up the global shipping industry, the Marshall Islands is starting at home. The Center recently published a framework that aims to fully decarbonise transport in the Marshall Islands by 2050. The framework is called Rebbelib 2050, named after the stick maps Marshallese navigators used for centuries as they traversed the long stretches of Pacific. Some of the potential technologies in the framework include wingships: vessels that are part-boat, part-plane that fly a few metres above the sea surface on a cushion of air. They're much faster and more fuel-efficient than a standard boat of the same size. The nation has partnered with South Korea on this project, along with another that aims to make sustainable fuel locally. The process, called ocean thermal energy conversion or OTEC, uses the temperature difference between warm water and cold water to generate electricity. Surplus energy could then go into creating hydrogen-based electrofuels, which could be used to power boats. Coral atolls near the equator, like those in the Marshall Islands, are ideal places to build OTEC facilities. That's because atolls tend to drop off like a cliff into the frigid depths, where the water's only around 4 degrees Celsius. Their surface waters hover around the high 20s. It's something the Marshall Islands hopes to trial with a pilot project later this year, Atina says. For the past few years, a venture into sustainable sea transport has operated from a tall A-frame building overlooking the lagoon. Waan AelÃµÃ± in Majel (WAM), or Canoes of the Marshall Islands, was originally founded to teach life skills, woodworking and sailing to young Marshallese men and women. A few years ago, the NGO branched out to teach traditional Marshallese boat-building to people from the less-populated outer islands. Four boat-builders from four islands travel to Majuro at a time, where they're given a place to stay and a wage. Over three months, the group builds four double-hulled sailing boats at WAM. The boat designs merge contemporary engineering with old-school Marshallese elements, and are made from easily accessible and modern materials, like marine plywood, rather than the traditional breadfruit wood. The builders learn how to sail and maintain the boats, and are dropped off on their home island with their newly made vessels. There are a plethora of reasons for outer island communities to harness the power of the wind, WAM associate director Tony Alik says â€” for instance, the price of oil, which is particularly expensive in regional areas. He hopes that communities will start using wind-powered canoes as their default mode of sea transport. ""I'm not against motor boats, I use them from time to time, but when you have the option to use alternative energy, it just makes sense to use it,"" Tony says. ""Especially living in the Marshall Islands where the skill is already there. The knowledge has been safeguarded for you."" Outside the WAM building is a catamaran with an addition: solar panels. ""Navigators in the past, they knew when to sail and when to stay home,"" Tony says. ""But unforeseen circumstances happen and unfortunately, sometimes the wind dies, and you're stuck."" This is where the addition of solar helps. Should a catamaran find itself on the open water with no wind, the solar motor kicks in. This catamaran's motor is missing; after only a couple of months' use, it was lost in a fire that destroyed WAM's adjoining classroom and museum. But WAM is buying more solar motors, Tony says. ""Then we're piloting those ones, so if they're really sustainable, easy to use and maintain, then the goal is to outfit all the canoes that we're sending to the outer islands with the option to have a solar motor."" Exactly how full decarbonisation in the Marshall Islands will look, and how much traditional boat-building skills or new technologies such as hydrogen-based electro-fuels will feed into it, is still, for the most part, unknown. But even though carbon emissions produced by diesel-powered Marshallese boats is barely a blip in the global total, Atina Schutz says transitioning into emission-free and fully sustainable sea transport ""is not just important for our society, but it's also our way of walking our talk"". Her message to the world's shipping industry is clear. ""The [global] shipping industry hasn't done much to mitigate its impacts on the climate system, so we need you to really step up and work with us in decarbonising the world fleet.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2023-09-05/marshall-islands-sustainable-sea-transport-climate-canoes/102743722

Is it because my dad was on Home and Away on Channel 7Â back in the day? ""Is it because I'm a public figure? Is it because I've publicly defended child transitioning?""

ir36,"When Fiona Elsey's mum was going through old mementos she'd kept since her daughter's death, she came across a letter written in the back of a colouring book. ""She would've had to have written this in the early hours of the morning when she was feeling most sad and lonely,"" Gail Elsey said. ""When IÂ read it I cried â€”Â I still get emotional about it. ""I just wanted my little girl to have her life back."" Fiona died from cancerÂ in 1991, at just 14Â years of age. In her letter, she expressedÂ optimism that some day she wouldÂ be cancer-free and couldÂ continue her life as a regular teenager. ""I am in hospital at the moment having cemo (sic) to help my tuma (sic) go away so as I can go back to playing squash and racketball (sic)Â and go back to school so I don't fail year seven and then when I get better we can go to Queensland and America so as we can go to Disneyland,"" Fiona wrote. ""When I get the all clear and get my central line taken out I can get my Maltese terrier and â€¦Â I'm going to spoil her rotten."" Her family and loved ones have since endeavoured to honour her legacy by setting up a cancer research institute in her name. ""I made a promise to her on her deathbed that I would never give up fighting for cancer research and what she wanted to happen,"" Ms Elsey said. ""I feel my role in this life now is to be her voice."" A few years after Fiona's passing, Ms Elsey bumped into Fiona's doctor George Kannourakis. ""We just happened to be coming out of Her Majesty's Theatre at the same time, and Gail turned around and said, you remember the promise you made my daughter?"" Professor Kannourakis said. Professor Kannourakis remembered â€”Â he had promised Fiona he would some day find a cure for the cancer that took the 14-year-old's life. That conversation was theÂ catalyst for setting up the Fiona Elsey Cancer Research Institute (FECRI). ""There was no cancer research or biological research laboratories in the Ballarat university in those days,"" he said. Professor Kannourakis met with the nuns of St John of God Hospital, who gave him a disused paint shed in the old boiler house to use as a laboratory. ""We opened the first little laboratory in the disused paint shed in February 1998,"" he said. The FECRI continues to be the only regional cancer research institute in all of Australia, and its work is internationally recognised. The FECRI held its bi-annual Dream BallÂ over the weekend to raise funds to further its research towards finding a cure for cancer. Ms Elsey called the event ""a celebration of her dream"". At this year's ball, a video was unveiled to guests that featured a reading of Fiona's words from the back of her colouring book. ""To hear those words again at the ball was very emotional, it was bittersweet,"" MsÂ Elsey said. Sarah Stapleton from the FECRI said the reaction to the video on the night was ""very powerful"". ""It is great to share the story with the guests, to hear a bit of where we came from and where we are going,"" she said. This year's Dream BallÂ raised over $220,000Â in funds, which Professor Kannourakis saidÂ was enough to employ two or three scientists per year. Before Fiona died, she took part in severalÂ medical trials to help doctors discover how her disease could be treated. Though they were unsuccessful in saving her life, they were able to help her regainÂ her lost ability to walk. These trials were what sparked Fiona's passion for cancer research. ""We are in the process of realising that dream for Fiona, and the main thing that we need is ongoing funding,"" Professor Kannourakis said. The FECRI is a community-funded organisation and reliesÂ on major events like the Dream Ball, and a cycle classic held in February each year, as well as generous donations fromÂ local businesses and community members. ""We've had to start up from scratch, so we didn't have any government support, and still don't,"" Professor Kannourakis said. The FECRI has made significant breakthroughs in cancer immunology research, and its work spans areas including but not limited to breast cancer, leukaemiaÂ and brain cancer. Ms Elsey is now on another cancer journey withÂ her husband, as he battles his ownÂ diagnosis. ButÂ this time, they have ""more research on [their] side"". While the institute's work has featured in manyÂ science publications and beenÂ internationally recognised, its biggest ambassadors are still counting on the generosity of the human spirit to fund its research. ""[Fiona] wanted to be a voice and send the message that if everybody got behind research, then treatments could improve and people's lives could be saved,"" Ms Elsey said. ""We are here on this earth to give and to love.

ir37,"Our relationship with pets has changed drastically in recent decades. Pet ownership is at an all-time high, withÂ a recent surveyÂ finding 69 per centÂ of Australian households have at least one pet. We spend an estimated $33 billion every year on caring for our fur babies. While owning a pet is linked to numerousÂ mental and physical health benefits, our pets can also harbour infectious diseases that can sometimes be passed on to us. For most people, the risk is low. But some, such as pregnant people and those with weakened immune systems, are atÂ greater riskÂ of getting sick from animals. So, it's important to know the risks and take necessary precautions to prevent infections. Infectious diseases that move from animals to humans are called zoonotic diseases orÂ zoonoses. More thanÂ 70 pathogensÂ of companion animals are known to be transmissible to people. Sometimes, a pet that has a zoonotic pathogen may look sick. But often there may be no visible symptoms, making it easier for you to catch it, because you don't suspect your pet of harbouring germs. Zoonoses can be transmitted directly from pets to humans, such as through contact with saliva, bodily fluids and faeces, or indirectly, such as through contact with contaminated bedding, soil, food or water. Studies suggestÂ the prevalence of pet-associated zoonoses is low. However, the true number of infections is likelyÂ underestimatedÂ since many zoonoses are not ""notifiable"", or may have multiple exposure pathways or generic symptoms. Dogs and cats are major reservoirs of zoonotic infections (meaning the pathogens naturally live in their population) caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites.Â In endemic regions in Africa and Asia, dogs are the main source of rabies which is transmitted through saliva. Dogs also commonly carry Capnocytophaga bacteriaÂ in their mouths and saliva, which can be transmitted to people through close contact or bites. The vast majority of people won't get sick, but these bacteria can occasionally cause infections in people with weakened immune systems,Â resultingÂ in severe illness and sometimes death. Just last week, such a deathÂ was reported in Western Australia. Cat-associated zoonoses include a number of illnesses spread by the faecal-oral route, such as giardiasis, campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis and toxoplasmosis. This means it's especially important to wash your hands or use gloves whenever handling your cat's litter tray. Cats can also sometimes transmit infections through bites and scratches, including the aptly namedÂ cat scratch disease, which is caused by the bacterium Bartonella henselae. Both dogs and cats are also reservoirs forÂ methicillin-resistant bacteriumÂ Staphylococcus aureusÂ (MRSA), with close contact with pets identified as an important risk factor for zoonotic transmission. But it's not just dogs and cats that can spread diseases to humans. Pet birds can occasionally transmitÂ psittacosis, a bacterial infection which causes pneumonia. Contact withÂ pet turtlesÂ has been linked to SalmonellaÂ infections in humans, particularly in young children. Even pet fish have been linked to aÂ range of bacterial infectionsÂ in humans, including vibriosis, mycobacteriosis and salmonellosis. Close contact with animals â€” and some behaviours in particular â€” increase the risk of zoonotic transmission.Â A study from the NetherlandsÂ found half of owners allowed pets to lick their faces, and 18 per centÂ allowed dogs to share their bed. (Sharing a bed increases the duration of exposure to pathogens carried by pets.) The same study found 45 per centÂ of cat owners allowed their cat to jump onto the kitchen sink. Kissing pets has also been linked to occasional zoonotic infections in pet owners.Â In one case, a woman in Japan developed meningitis due toÂ Pasteurella multicoda infection, after regularly kissing her dog's face. These bacteria are often found in the oral cavities of dogs and cats. Young children are also more likely to engage in behaviours which increase their risk ofÂ getting sickÂ from animal-borne diseases â€” such as putting their hands in their mouth after touching pets. Children are also less likely to wash their hands properly after handling pets. Although anybody who comes into contact with a zoonotic pathogen via their pet can become sick, certain people are more likely to suffer from serious illness. These people include the young, old, pregnant and immunosuppressed. For example, while most people infected with the toxoplasmosis parasite will experience only mild illness, it can be life-threatening orÂ cause birth defects in foetuses. There are a number of good hygiene and pet husbandry practices that can reduce your risk of becoming sick. These include: It is especially important for those who are at a higher risk of illness to take precautions to reduce their exposure to zoonotic pathogens. And if you're thinking about getting a pet, ask your vet which type of animal would best suit your personal circumstances.

ir38,"Every six months, Erica Packer steels herself for the latest round of exploratory tests â€” mammograms, MRIs, maybe a biopsy of her breast tissue. Every day after the tests are done, she waits nervously for the results, the same thought buzzing in her head: ""Is it this time? Is it this time?"" The former international model and ex-wife of one of Australia's richest men, James Packer, might appear genetically blessed, but she lives with the fear that she carries the same unidentified genetic mutation that caused the breast cancer that killed her mother, Sheelah, at 66, and almost all female relatives on her mother's side. ""Breast cancer has been a fatal thing in my family,"" says Erica, 46, from her home in London. It's scary, she says, and the best she can do to mitigate the risk is endure the emotionally exhausting routine of having breast cancer screening every six months. ""I'm biopsied all the time. You don't know the results for days. So you're sort of put in this very vulnerable position,"" she tells Australian Story. ""It's a bit like playing Russian roulette."" Erica's older sister, Jo Hunter, knows what it's like when those tests come back positive. At 39, and a mother to four young children, the Sydneysider was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction. She's the only woman in the family to survive a breast cancer diagnosis. It's clear, the sisters and scientists say, that susceptibility to breast cancer lurks within their family's DNA. Some hereditary gene mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer are known. The BRCA1 and BRAC2 mutations are the most common and best known, gaining international focus when Hollywood actress, Angelina Jolie, revealed she had the BRCA1 gene mutation and had chosen to have a preventative double mastectomy. Jo, now 50, was tested for those mutations a year after her diagnosis. She was not a carrier. The National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) has dubbed these mystery genetic faults running through thousands of Australian families ""missing matches"". ""Jo and Erica's story is not an unfamiliar story,"" NBCFÂ chief executive officer Cleola Anderiesz says. ""There are many, many Australian families who have a very similar story."" In the past decade, however, vast advances have been made in the field. Women can now be tested for up to 10 genetic variants, with another 40-plus being researched at facilities such as Victoria's Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Now Jo is being re-tested in the hope that these new discoveries in genetics can help solve the mystery that has dogged her family â€” and many others â€” for generations. Erica doesn't seek the spotlight. The woman who once dated stage and screen star Jason Donovan, who jetted off to Jamaica and Cuba on exotic fashion shoots, who partied with Elton John, is happy now to keep a low-profile as she raises the children she shares with James; Indigo, 15, Jackson, 13, and Emmanuelle, 10. But her quest for answers about genetic mutations is strong: strong enough for her to open the shutters on her private life in a bid to put a spotlight on the ongoing research into genetic mutations and the need to fund it. ""I feel very passionate about it because this is our family,"" Erica says. ""We're one of the missing matches and there's so many families in this country, 100,000 Aussies probably, in the same boat. ""If we can get these genetic causes and find out which specific one I might have, my daughters might have, anyone can have, then you can also not go through all this worry."" She had a big scare last year. Heading off on holidays, she and the kids had already boarded the plane when her doctor called to say the results of recent testing were ""not good"". It took more than a month of anxiety â€“ as further tests were organised in foreign countries â€“ before she was given the all clear. ""You're suddenly smacked in the face with your own mortality and being a single mum of three kids and what that meant for our lives and what we were going to do. That uncertainty and that â€¦ fear."" Erica and Jo were living together in London in 1999 when that fear first touched their immediate family. Jo, a nurse, had relocated with her doctor husband, David Hunter, and their then two-year-old son, Jordan, while Erica was jetting about as a model â€” then coming back to London to share a bedroom with Jordan and his purple Teletubby toy. Then came the shocking news: their mother had breast cancer. Sheelah, the no-nonsense woman who raised her three children in Gunnedah, north-eastern NSW with solicitor husband, Michael, was adamant her daughters stay in London for the time being. Their brother, Billy, was able to come home to be with his parents as Sheelah had a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Despite a prognosis that she would only live a few months, Sheelah went into remission. Life went on. Jo and David moved to Boston, US, adding two boys and a girl to their family. Erica's life was hitting some high notes, too: she embarked on a singing career, releasing an album. And she was dating the ""funny and charming and very dynamic"" James, the son of the late media mogul, Kerry Packer. ""It's a very big life with James,"" Erica says. ""It was amazing to be a part of that, getting to meet all these world leaders and fascinating people, these big brains and people that are changing the world."" Come 2007, Erica and James were married at a private ceremony followed by a lavish celebration held on the French Riviera. Her mum, Sheelah was there, of course, but doing her best to hide intense back pain. On her return to Australia, Sheelah learned the cancer was back. It had metastasised through her pelvis and lung. By 2011, it was in her liver. That same year, Jo was diagnosed with breast cancer. ""As the saying goes,"" says Jo, ""when it rains, it pours. It sure poured."" Jo's cancer was picked up early and the double mastectomy has minimised the risk of its return. But Sheelah had run out of treatment options. Late in 2011, the extended family gathered onboard the Packer family yacht in Fiji and with her family around her, Sheelah died. ""She went to bed and she didn't end up getting up again,"" Erica says. ""As tough as that time was, we all feel really grateful that we could be there with her on the boat as she passed and holding her hand and giving her a lot of love."" Two years later, Erica and James separated. But, Erica says, there's still a lot of love between them. ""Divorce is never fun for any couple,"" she says. ""And there's obviously speed bumps in the road and it's always tricky and you've got to navigate your way through. ""But I'm really proud of the fact that we've worked really hard to maintain a good relationship and a respectful relationship and a caring relationship because we both love our three kids so much and we have a lot of love for each other still. ""We found such a lovely way to co-parent and we take care of each other in how we each co-parent the kids,"" says Erica, who remains close to James' mother, Ros, and sister Gretel. ""And I'm grateful for the support that James gives me."" Now, Erica is settling back into London where she and the kids recently moved after spending nine years in Los Angeles. The children's upbringing, with the wealth of the Packer family behind them, is vastly different to her childhood, when going out for a meal at the Gunnedah Chinese restaurant was a rare and special event, but she tries to ""create that sense of love and safety and security that I was fortunate to have as a kid"". She's an ambassador for UNICEF Australia, most recently working alongside the Moriarty Foundation to bring early childhood centres to Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory, and is still involved in the fashion industry. Then there's her work with the National Breast Cancer Foundation. It's been a 25-year association, alongside Jo and their late mum, Sheelah. It's a family thing. Jo knows that early detection of breast cancer and targeted treatment saves lives, with the five-year survival rate increasing from 76 per cent to 92 per cent since around the time her mother was diagnosed. She often visits women who have recently learned they have breast cancer to mentor them through their treatment. In fact, Jo is so proud of her breast reconstruction that she will, as Erica puts it, ""show them her boobs"". ""I think there was a joke at one stage,"" recalls Jo, ""that there wasn't a person left in Sydney that hadn't seen my breasts."" ""The Peep Show Queen,"" jokes Erica. ""Who knew?"" Nothing quite as revealing is required for Jo's new round of genetic testing: just a simple blood or saliva test. Jo's test for the currently confirmed eight to 10 genetic mutations was done through the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, but one of its leading researchers, Professor Ian Campbell, emphasises that no matter where a woman â€“ or man â€” lives, they can access these tests. If a patient, or their GP, suspects they have, or are at risk of, familial breast cancer, a GP can organise for testing kits to be posted. ""That DNA can be sent to the laboratory to get that test so it doesn't matter whether you live in the CBD or some outback town,"" he explains. Genetic counselling can be provided face-to face at specialised familial cancer centres in every metropolitan city, or through video-conferencing. For every 100 women who get breast cancer, Professor Campbell says, about 10 to 15 of them will have an inherited gene mutation. Up to 40 per cent of those women will be able to learn the type of mutation through today's advanced tests. But for the other 60 per cent, ""it's a mystery"". It's a mystery the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre is at the forefront of trying to solve, with the help of funding from a variety of sources, including the National Breast Cancer Foundation. Its special ingredient is the women of Australia: 9,000 of them with an unexplained hereditary breast cancer, along with tens of thousands of others without breast cancer used as control cases. ""The research we're doing here we believe is unique in the world in that we have a very large number of women who are part of our cohort who have been tested for all the known genes, but returned a negative result,"" Professor Campbell says. ""Those women have kindly given us permission to look deeply at their genes to see if we can find an explanation."" As a result, another 40-plus genetic mutations that may cause breast cancer are under examination, identified by advances in technology that enable machines to read up to 10 billion DNA sequences overnight. ""That's absolutely transformed how we could do the research looking at familial breast cancer,"" he says. But, he cautions, there's still more work to be done to confirm the link between these 40-plus genetic errors and cancer. Source: National Breast Cancer Foundation Many of the women in the study are referred to Professor Campbell's research by his colleague Professor Paul James, the director of the centre's familial cancer clinic. Professor James says the value of pinpointing these genetic mutations is targeted testing and treatment. ""If we can identify your risk successfully through genetics, then we can offer more,"" he says. ""Earlier screening, different types of screening like MRI â€¦ we can offer medications that can bring down your risk."" About 150 women die each year of breast cancer caused by unknown familial genetic errors, ProfessorÂ James says, ""that should have been preventable if we'd understood the underlying high-risk cause"". For now, the genetic fault that has haunted Jo, Erica and their family remains unknown, with results from Jo's recent testing for the eight to 10 known genetic mutations still being processed. If Jo is found to have one of the genetic faults, Erica will undergo the same tests to determine if she is also a carrier. If it comes back positive, Erica's screening and treatment options will be clearer. If nothing is found in Jo's tests, Erica's best chance of diagnosing cancer early will remain regular testing. ""The good thing about it is if you're checked often enough,"" Erica says, ""if cancer did develop, you can handle it."" But the search will go on. Jo is so eager to find answers, she plans to donate her genetic material to the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre's research team, adding more valuable data for scientists to explore. Much has been discovered in the past 10 years, with more to come, and these two sisters are in this search for the long haul â€“ for themselves, their daughters and every person whose family tree has suffered way too many fallen branches.

ir39,"On a bright winter afternoon a small group of family members stood on a clifftop and threw white roses into churning sea near Bondi. They came to remember their beloved John Russell, a 31-year-old popular local barman who was thrown off the cliffs by unknown assailants at Marks Park, Tamarama, in 1989, probably because he was gay. For 34 years his relatives have carried the immense weight of grief, anger and pain, and the mystery of not knowing who killed him. ""It's still unfinished,"" cousin James Brooking toldÂ 7.30. ""We've all just got to live in hope and have the belief that eventually justice will be made to all the victims, but also to the survivors."" Marks Park was notorious for attacks on gay men during that era in Sydney. Gangs were known to carry out assaults and robberies, one group calling itself the Park Side Killers. ""They were just a whole bunch of cowards.Â They were strong in packs,"" Mr Brooking said. Some offenders were jailed for their crimes, but other killers could still be alive today, walking freely among us. ""They're probably everywhere,"" he said. ""Who do you know who you're standing next to?"" John Russell's younger brother, Peter, remembers the day police officers told him they found John's body, which he identified at Glebe Coroners Court. Life was not the same without his best mate. ""Drinking like a wild man, I grieved heavily for the first three or four years,"" he told 7.30. Joyous moments like the birth of grandchildren came and went, but underneath, he put plainly:Â ""S**t like this gets you down. You've got to put it away."" Since then, Mr Russell has been the family's indefatigable public face, vowing to find John's killer or killers until none in the clan is left. ""It's a story that has to be told,"" he said. ""As hard as it is, it's what it is. ""It's been a very long and arduous 34 years to get to this point, and anything that can lead us to the path of closure or any form of answer is why we're here."" Mr Russell has given evidence in the NSW Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ hate crimes, which is re-examining John Russell's case, along with more than 30 other unsolved cases of suspected gay-hate deathsÂ dating back to the 1970s. Justice for John may have come sooner, Mr Russell believes, had the police been more thorough in their investigation in the beginning. ""[It was]Â appalling at best,"" he said. The initial police investigation deemed John's fall from the cliff as accidental, but a coronial inquest in 1990 could not determine whether or not he fell accidentally. In 2005, a second inquest confirmed the family's suspicions that John ""was thrown from the cliff onto rocks by a person or persons unknown"", with the deputy state coroner Jacqueline Milledge slamming aspects of the initial police investigation as disgraceful. Police had collected a vital clue at the crime scene â€”Â human hair in John's hand â€”Â but later lost it. The whereabouts of this evidence, which may have led to a DNA breakthrough today, remains unknown. The inquiry has heard of numerous gaps in police investigations, including lost or destroyed evidence. The commission of inquiry isÂ seeking to determine whether these lapses were the result of anti-gay bias among police But Duncan McNab, who served with New South Wales Police in the 1970s and 80s, including as a detective,Â told 7.30 they wereÂ more likely to be human error. ""Never put conspiracy before a stuff-up because a stuff-up comes first, so I don't think that in most of these cases there are darker purposes involved,"" he said. ""We'd like to think the exhibits were kept in pristine condition from day one through to decades.Â It simply just doesn't happen."" However, he believesÂ homophobia mayÂ have played a part in some investigations. ""I think there was some anti-gay bias, or just, you know, 'They got what they deserved,' or 'If the blokes weren't hanging around cliff faces in the middle of the night it wouldn't have happened so, you know, tough, you play the game and this is the result.'Â And for some police this was obviously in their minds."" For the past tenÂ months of hearings, Peter Russell has travelled from his home on the Central Coast to Sydney to listen to evidence, even in cases unrelated to his brother's. In June, he and his wife â€”Â a close friend of John's â€”Â Donna Russell, made the trip to the historic sandstone Chief Secretary's BuildingÂ to read out their family impact statements. Sitting in the witness stand before Justice John Sackar, Mr Russell said of his brother: ""He was the most caring soul anyone could meet â€¦ The grief was hard to take."" Wiping tears from her face, Ms Hannah told the hearing: ""Because of the circumstances of John's death, I have trust issuesÂ and I worry and I panic when my kids go out at night. I can't sit still, I can't sleep, my mind runs away, and I think of all kind of possibilities that may occur until I know they're home again."" ""My kids are now 32, 30 and 26, and I still worry. I'm afraid that something terrible will happen to them. I know it's unreasonable, but it's hard not to have these thoughts."" In one of his last moments with dementia, Peter and John's late father cried out for John, she told the inquiry. ""It was a very sad moment to see him with tears and fear in his eyes,"" she said. ""These were his last lucid moments in his life."" Some of the cases are so old that there are no family members left to speak up for the victims.Â Some have died or cannot be contacted, others have been reluctant to speak publicly. Do murder victims exist if there's no one left to mourn, or care about them? Twenty-six-year-old Gilles Mattaini's life is described vividly by his partner Jacques Musy in a short two-page family impact statement. The two men from France were deeply in love. They built a life together in Bondi in the 1980s. ""That was it, our destiny was mapped out for us forever; strong together to face all the hurdles of life,"" Mr Musy wrote in his statement. In September 1985 Mr Mattaini disappeared. He was last seen walking in Bondi, but his body has never been found. A coronial inquest concluded he died but the cause and manner of his death is unknown. ""Sleep was my only respite before waking up to the daylight nightmare instantly crushing my mind and my heart again,"" Mr Musy wrote. ""My whole life had swung from happiness to nightmare, destroying all my future, all my life."" ""Weeks, months, years of pain had shattered my life forever.Â I have never emotionally recovered and been able to tie emotions with anyone."" ""I will miss forever Gilles, the luminous beacon who once lit my life."" Stunning breakthroughs in cold cases are not unheard of, such as in the high-profile death of Scott Johnson, whose attacker Scott White was jailed for manslaughter 35 years after Mr Johnson died. In John Russell's case, the inquiry has sent the clothes he was wearing at the time for new DNA testing, while a $100,000 police reward for information that leads to a conviction still stands. Peter Russell doubts the reward will be enough for anyone to come forward and wants it increased to $1 million. But John's cousin, James Brooking, told 7.30 he held onto the hope of a breakthrough similar to that in the Johnson case. ""Maybe in the future, like Scott's result, (a breakthrough) will also come for us with John,"" Mr Brooking said. ""I always have a motto in life that says, 'To leave love behind means you never leave,' and I can see John standing at that spot.Â And the love that he's left behind, we know that he's not gone, but we just hope that he has justice."" ""Even though John is somewhere, we still support him,"" he said. ""We'll never stop loving him.""

ir40,"When Ukraine's Foreign MinisterÂ Dmytro Kuleba last week told critics of his country's counteroffensive to ""shut up"", accusing them of ""spitting in the faces"" of frontline soldiers, it was obvious who his fury was directed at. Over the past few weeks, anonymous ""Western officials"" have been speaking to USÂ newspapers, giving bleak assessments of Ukraine's counteroffensive and its ability to sever Russia's land bridge to Crimea by the end of the year. During a visit to Spain last week, Mr Kuleba dared those unnamed critics toÂ ""come to Ukraine and try to liberate one square centimetre by themselves"". While the pace of the counteroffensive may have been slower than expected in the past three months, there is cause for optimism amongst Western allies over Ukraine's progress in this past week. On Friday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby was upbeat in his latest assessment. ""We have noted over the last 72 hours or so, some notable progress by Ukrainian armed forces ... in that southern line of advance coming out of the Zaporizhzhia area,"" he said. The recent liberation of the village of Robotyne has been a huge morale boost for Ukrainian forces. Mr Kuleba described it as the first step to cutting off the land bridge and strangling Russian supply lines. ""We are opening the way to Tokmak and, eventually, Melitopol and the administrative border with Crimea,"" he said. It was so-called USÂ intelligence community assessments in the Washington Post on August 17 that predicted that Ukraine would fail to reach the occupied city of Melitopol in its counteroffensive. Melitopol is around 80 kilometres from Robotyne. The assessments published in the Post were based on an assumption that you need to recapture the city to cut off the rail and road supply lines that are keeping Russian troops in the fight. Dr Jan Kallberg, a senior fellow at the Centre for European Policy Analysis and an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the US Military Academy, has told the ABC that assumption is based on flawed logic, and that if Ukraine can push another 10-15kmÂ beyond Robotyne, that could be enough. ""You don't really need to reach all the way to Melitopol to have a significant impact on Russia's options. You don't need to reach the shores of the Sea of Azov before logistics start to crumble on the Russian side,"" he said. For any fighting force to operate effectively it needs what's referred to as a ground line of communicationÂ â€”Â a transport route that allows military units to be supplied with food, fuel, artillery, spare parts for vehicles and other reinforcements. Dr Kallberg saidÂ Russia's transport route ranÂ aroundÂ 7-10km inland of Melitopol, and if Ukraine couldÂ punch through another 10-15kmÂ of territory from Robotyne, it would be enough to put this key supply line under the range of its rocket launchers and artillery systems. ""A lot of the rear Russian logistics are not driven by low capacity tactical trucks, but instead by regular haulers, private companies with a far higher capacity per truckload,"" he said. ""If they're under the threat of ongoing artillery barrages on the highways and checkpoints, the civilian part, unless forced to collaborate, will start pulling out."" Dr Kallberg said territorial gains by Ukraine could not only strangle supply routes, but have a huge impact on where Russia stagedÂ its command posts and stores its artillery. ""As a commander, you need to be close to the front. But how can you be close to the front when pretty much all the operational areas are under the gun? ""If you start moving artillery shells, let's say 3,000 shells a day, you need stockpiling somewhere. You can't stockpile in the Sea of Azov. You can't stockpile in the ocean."" Following the liberation of Robotyne, Ukraine's armed forces have continued to push in a broad axis towards Tokmak, a crucial strategic and logistical hub for Russia. Mr Kirby said that Ukraine had ""achieved some success against that second line of Russian defences"". The exiled mayor of Melitopol,Â Ivan Federov, said via his Telegram channel that after 18 months of occupation, Tokmak was once again becoming a frontline city, and that there were reports that Russian-installed authorities were in the process of fleeing. ""The enemy's defence is cracking, so the first rats run from the sinking Russian ship,"" he said. ""According to residents, the local occupying 'authority' have one foot out the door,Â they are being transported to another city."" Nick Reynolds is a research fellow in land warfare from the Royal United Services Institute â€”Â an independent defence and security think tank. He told the ABC that while Russia had set up ""deep defences"" in most areas, its tiring soldiers had ""taken quite a battering"". ""To be honest, it looks like they are starting to crumble,"" he said. Mr Reynolds said Russia's logistics network in the area was ""very well understood"". ""You know, it's visible from space,"" he said. ""And it's quite obvious that area is very significant for them in terms of being able to sustain themselves in theatre. ""So the fact that Ukrainian is getting close to that is, for the Russians, a very bad thing."" As well as being Russia's east-west supply artery, the rail and road corridor is a critical path to the Crimea Peninsula, which Vladimir Putin illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Dr Kallberg said if Ukraine couldÂ continue to push forward it will begin to impact those living in occupied Crimea. ""Any disruptions of the Russian logistics will also bear a weight on Crimea's civil population of about one and a half million that themselves need resources,"" he said. In an address in Paris last week, Mr Kuleba shed some light on the liberation of Robotyne, which involved 31 fighters. He said a third of the group, that he believes ""opened the way to Tokmak"", had no combat experience. ""In 18 hours, they literally crawled on their bellies through kilometres of minefields, where the Russians placed six mines for every square metre,"" Mr Kuleba said. ""A group of 31 people did the work of an entire battalion, which should have consisted of about 400 people."" Meanwhile Russian forces are battling fatigue and issues around morale. Mr Reynolds said there were signs the Russian forces were exhausted, and having to spend ""weeks or months"" at a time on the frontline. ""For contrast, if we look at the British military in World War I, which were also holding trenches, they eventually came to a three-week cycle whereby the troops would spend a week in the frontline, a week in the second line, a week away where they could rest and recuperate. ""That was what was seen as appropriate after a lot of experience of trench warfare. ""Quite simply, the Russians aren't able to do anything close to that and troops are being kept on the front line for extensive periods of time."" Dr Kallberg believes that Russia is facing other hurdles as well. ""They're pulling out of storage drawn artillery pieces that, by Western standards, are 1950s, 1960s standard. And they have lost a lot of their ability to do counter battery fire. They have lost artillery radars. And they're losing artillery at speed,"" he said. And he thinks the change in seasons will further help Ukraine. ""All Russian arrangements will be visible when the leaves fall in October, and the Ukrainians have precision long-range firepower. So the Ukrainians can methodically take out position after position."" However nothing is certain in war. Russia has already defied expectations with the strength of its defensive lines that have stalled Ukraine's counteroffensive through a series of minefields, trenches, ""dragon's teeth""Â barricades and anti-tank ditches. There were reports at the weekend that Russian forces were making the clearing of these minefields even more hazardous by dumping inflammable agents on the areas and igniting them with drone-launched grenades. Moscow has also moved more troops into the region including elite units to help combat Ukraine's push. Kamikaze drones have been effectively used by Russia to try and slow the counteroffensive. Ukraine's lack of air power continues to be a handbrake on its progress. However Dr Kallberg believes Ukraine can push through that crucial 10-15kmÂ before the ground freezes in winter. ""I think [they can]Â unless the Ukrainians have a morale implosion, where they are taking a lot of casualties and hardship."" He believes as winter approaches the issues around logistics could cripple Russia's ability to fight and that Mr Putin will face a stark choice.Â  ""He can fight on and risk mass troop surrenders, or pull back. Either way the so-called land bridge from Russia to Crimea will be snapped,"" he said.",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-04/why-ukraine-counteroffensive-could-be-close-to-major-prize/102801456
ir41,"Tens of thousands of peopleÂ at the Burning Man Festival in the United States have been left stranded in the desert after torrential rain turned the eventÂ into a muddy mess.Â  The site is in Nevada's Black Rock Desert â€” a large, flat, ancient lake bed known as a playa. An investigation has been launched after police revealed one person has died. Here's how the chaos unfolded.Â  Every year the festivalÂ brings people to the desert to dance, make art and enjoy being part of a self-sufficient, temporary community of like-minded spirits. This year's version opened on August 27, welcoming in over 60,000 and was scheduled to run through to Monday. Between Friday and Saturday night festival-goersÂ were unable to enter or exitÂ the siteÂ after heavy rains inundated itsÂ location at Black Rock Desert.Â  The area received twoÂ to threeÂ months â€” or 20.8Â millimetres â€” of rain in just 24 hours, according to the Associated Press.Â  Festival-goer David Date told Reuters the rain was unprecedented.Â  ""I've been bringing art toÂ BurningÂ ManÂ for seven years, and we're out here with a solid group of veteran burners. Some people have been doing this for 20 years, and we've never seen anything like this. We've gotten about an inch of rainfall over the last 48 hours."" On Saturday, Burning Man organisers closed the gate and the airport in and out of Black Rock City and told people to stay alert.Â  The closures came just before a large wooden effigy was supposed to have been burned on Saturday night.Â  On Sunday organisers closed the festival to vehicles after one death was reported. The Pershing County Sheriff's Office confirmed the death on social media in a statement.Â  ""The Pershing County Sheriff's Office is currently investigating a death which occurred during this rain event,"" it said. ""The family has been notified and the death is under investigation. As this death is still under investigation, there is no further information available at this time."" People were urged to find shelter and ration their food as roads in and out continued to stay closed on Sunday.Â  As punters remained unable to get in or out of the event, many tried to make the best of it.Â  ""People are taking care of each other. We have food, we have provisions, we have shelter. So it's really just kind of a group effort to get through this until the roads dry up,"" Mr Date said.Â  Paul RederÂ and his friends have not been able to venture more than 10 metresÂ from their RVÂ since the area was hit with rain on Friday. ""The community here atÂ BurningÂ ManÂ just has a different attitude about some of this stuff,"" he said. ""We're still been preparing meals ...and sharing with people that are in need."" Others partied into the night.Â  ""When you get pushed to extremes, that's when the most fun happens,"" said Brian Fraoli, a veteran ""burner"".Â  He said he had tried to drag his luggage through the mud and escape, but gave up and decided to relax and enjoy the experience. ""Overall it was an amazing week and next time we will be more prepared,"" he said. From Sunday some attendees were able to get out of the festival by walking out of the grounds and getting on buses or hitchhiking.Â  But that became more challenging as conditions worsened.Â  Officials said late Saturday they didn't yet know when the roads would ""be dry enough for RVs or vehicles to navigate safely"",Â but they were hopeful vehicles could depart by late Monday if weather conditions improved. Some with larger four-wheel drives managed to make it out.Â  Celebrity DJ Diplo posted a video to Instagram on Saturday evening showing him and comedian Chris Rock riding in the back of a fan's pick-up truck. He said they had walked almost 10 kilometres through the mud before hitching a ride. ""I legit walked the side of the road for hours with my thumb out,"" wrote Diplo.Â  But there are still tens of thousands currently stuck.Â  The latest update from officials was on Sunday at 6:30pm local time.Â  ""Despite afternoon drizzle, the conditions are improving on the playa. The roads in Black Rock City remain too wet and muddy to officially open them for Exodus on Sunday 9/3,"" it said.Â  ""We will be opening for Exodus on Monday morning 9/4. We will inform the community as soon as we make the decision by 9am.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-04/how-burning-man-2023-unfolded/102810200
ir42,"When Gerard Nicol moved to a 161.87-hectare property on an unnamed road in Dharawal Country near Braidwood in NSW, he wanted an address. The 2-kilometreÂ dirt road that leads to Mr Nicol's property, three other private properties and a state forest were transferred from Crown Lands to the local council in October 2021. But it was never given a name. When Mr Nicol approached Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council to name the road, they asked him for input. His first idea was to consult with Indigenous elders in the area. However, Mr Nicol said there was no obvious body or organisation to approach. So he researched the local Indigenous history on the internet and stumbled upon the name Jack Bawn. According to the autobiography of Braidwood policeman Martin Brennan, Aboriginal communities from the NSW south coast and inland to Braidwood gathered for a corroboree on the Braidwood goldfields in 1872. After the meeting, elder Jack Bawn, representing 62 elders from the region, approached Mr Brennan and asked for land for his people to settle on and make their own. Mr Bawn was granted 40 acres â€” 19.83 hectares. University of Technology Sydney emeritus professor Heather Goodall, whose work Mr Nicol found online, said Mr Bawn's case was not unique. She said accounts of Crown landÂ being reserved for Indigenous people appeared in the historical records from about the 1840s in response to Aboriginal people petitioning authorities for land to try and build a future. But while Dr Goodall saysÂ Jack Bawn's case ""wasn't exceptional"", what isÂ unusual is for individuals like Mr Bawn to appear in written records. ""It is very rare to find records being kept because it was very rare for white people to write this down,"" she said. ""We have to scrape the archives just to find a shred of evidence."" Dr Goodall said it was unlikely Mr Bawn ever took possession of the land because the portion was landlocked by hostile neighbouring farmers. If he did access the land, Dr Goodall said it was probably reclaimed by the Aborigines Protection Board in the 1930s. ""We have no records of what happened to Jack Bawn after that,"" she said. She said that naming a road after an individual Indigenous person was uncommon, but it wouldÂ be fitting to name it after theÂ Indigenous elder. ""Recognising people is a really important part of understanding what it means to have come to a country where there's an 80,000-year history and inheritance,"" Dr GoodallÂ said. ""Even though it's a little back road, it is a road. It is a recognition."" Batemans Bay Aboriginal Land Council has given approval for Mr Nicol to submit the name 'Jack Bawn Road'Â to the Geographical Names Board of NSW. If approved by the board, Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council will then vote on renaming the road. Mr Nicol said if the name was approved, it would be a ""fittingly modest tribute"" to Jack Bawn. ""This is probably one of the most insignificant roads in the whole of NSW,"" Mr Nicol said. ""Jack Bawn was a modest man who asked for a modest parcel of land, received it, and then was denied access to it. ""It's significant in its insignificance.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-04/push-to-name-nsw-back-road-near-braidwood-after-indigenous-elder/102804156
ir43,"When Jade Kurray received a shock diagnosis of brain cancer, she made a snap decision to buyÂ a hotted up pink Commodore.Â  Two years later, and with a clean bill of health, she finally had a chanceÂ to show it off in a street parade through Alice SpringsÂ in front of 25,000 revheads from across the country. ""It was just one of those heat-of-the-moment things,"" Ms Kurray said. ""I had a brain aneurism, they found a tumour, and I deadset thought I was going to die. ""I was like, 'Pink car â€“ that is me'."" Described as ""the ultimate festival of wheels"", Red CentreNATS rolled into Alice Springs for its ninth instalment over the weekend, delighting motor enthusiasts with high-octane drag racing, burnouts and motorkhana. The event also boasted the only permit in Australia that allowed unregistered and highly modified vehicles to be driven on public roads for a glitzy and glamorous street parade. ""One of the most special things about the Red CentreNATS is the way that the town and the city embraces the event,"" festival director Andy Lopez said. ""It's not a transplanted event.Â It grew out of a community desire to have this type of festival hereÂ and, as such, the Red CentreNATS was built to meet those expectations and desires. ""Everytime we come to Alice Springs, the town and the people throw their arms open and welcome us, and that's really different to what you might sometimes get in metropolitan areas."" For Cody Free, who travelled from Tasmania for his third Red CentreNATs, it was the ""killer atmosphere"" that kept him coming back for more. The Pro Class burnout competitor was focused on ticking all the boxes for the judges this time around. ""You want constant smoke, big smoke, do all the corners of the pads, then there's the exit shoot,"" he said. ""And of course, just hold on and have a good time. ""We built the car from the ground up â€¦ so a lot of hours have gone into it, and a lot of money as well, as you can see."" Other fan favourites of the event include the show'n'shine â€“ giving car owners the opportunity to show off their prized rides â€”Â grudge racing for amateur drivers wanting to duke it out on the drag, and the Mulletfest competition. NT Major Events Company (NTMEC), the government-owned body that runs Red CentreNATS, has pushed to make the annual festival one that can be enjoyed by the whole family. ""People just love coming to celebrate what they love, which in this case is a lot of drag and a lot of racing and a lot of motorsport activities,"" chief executive Suzana Bishop said. ""Lots of people are coming to the town, filling restaurants, filling accommodation, and really celebrating what they love the most."" She said there were about 600 entrants in this year's street parade, a substantial drop on the 2022 event where a tourism surge after pandemic restrictions eased resulted in more than 1,000 participants.

ir44,"After winning justÂ two matches in 12Â years and being dubbed '""Australia'sÂ worst footy team"",Â this country football club has won its first-ever league premiership grand final.Â  Between 2008 andÂ 2021, the Albany Sharks had won only two solitary games, beforeÂ former AFL star Brett Peake pulled on a teal guernsey and helped the team to its first grand final last year. But it was a sweet September and one to remember for the Albany Sharks as the siren sounded inÂ Mount Barker in Western Australia's south on Saturday.Â Â  They hadÂ done it.Â  The ultimate underdogs had finally claimed a flag after years of heartbreak, defeating Albany Railways 9.12 (66)Â to 7.6 (48). Led by the likes of captain Tait McLean and former Fremantle and St Kilda champion Peake, paired with a stellar effort from players and those working behind the scenes, the Albany Sharks made history.Â  The club also has the Great Southern Football League's only current female president and she believes the secret to success is more about what is done off the field than on it.Â  Albany Sharks president Tracy Blaszkow had little voice left by the final siren.Â  She was pictured on her knees in disbelief when she knew Railways could no longer catch her team with the time left on the clock.Â  And after being within a goal in the final term, the Sharks were considerably lucky to swim away with the three-goal win.Â  ""I realised we've actually won this bloody thing ... I couldn't believe it, I fell to my knees.Â The emotion drained out of me. It was ridiculous,"" she said.Â  Ms Blaszkow recalled being asked for an interview a few years ago on her club's losing track record.Â  ""I remember the interviewer ringing me up and I said: 'I don't want a story about how sh*t we are because I know we're sh*t' and he asked why I was still here and I said because I love the people,"" Ms Blaszkow said.Â  The story ended up being about how the ""worst club""Â was the ""best club to be at""Â because of the family atmosphere.Â  ""I think the key to the success so far for this club has been building off field, not on field;Â we had to get the right coaches, the right people on the committee, the right people supporting the clubÂ  before we could actually attract the players."" Peake said the win was ""gritty"", admitting that it almost slipped out of his side's hands. ""I just said to all the forwards and the mids that we just have to keep on grinding and it'll come ... I was proud of the way we defended. We're a blue collar team so when we get to work and get our hands dirty we play good footy,"" Peake said. ""It's a pretty special occasion."" Coach Jamie Ram said the win took a lot of hard work and a ""will to win"".Â  ""They [the players] are pretty fit ... it has taken a lot of hours and a lot of work behind the scenes,"" he said.Â  Albany Sharks captain McLean said he had the belief in the boysÂ and was grateful for the community support.Â  ""Just to really feel like the wider community is behind you and wants to see you succeed is something that we as players really want to tap into,"" McLean said.Â  ""One of the things that came up was that we want to do it for our families and the people we love. ""My mum's a good example of someone who has put in a lot of work ... when things got tough we've got to [remember that we're doing this] for everyone else as well."" McLean's mum, Sharon, volunteers in the club's canteen and said the win reduced her to tears.Â  ""It was worth every hard moment that we've been through,"" she said.Â  ""I think of those bad times, my son got to the point where he didn't even know if he liked football anymore and went to Sydney for the year and thought 'yeah I do' and came back and found another gear. ""People say it's just football, but we're a family."" Ex-president, life member and time keeper Geoff Oldfield said the win was ""surreal and like a dream"". ""I nearly had a heart attack,"" Mr Oldfield said.Â  ""It's the best thing that has ever happened. It is worth every beating we've ever had.""Â Â  Mr Oldfield said football was good for players' mental heath and that the win meant a lot to the entire community.Â  He said football saved lives.Â  ""Some people come to the footy club and we clean their life up. They might have had problems with substances, they get off them, they get another reason to exist. ""They make new friends.Â I know one woman who was leaving town, no friends. She met a bloke, and she's not leaving town all because of footy."" The club legends now hope that the women's team can win next year's flag after falling short in their grand final earlier in the year.Â",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-04/abany-sharks-go-from-australias-worst-footy-team-premiership-win/102808758
ir45,"ForÂ awe hunters, the everyday is often the extraordinary and the smallest wonders can be transformative. Their secrets can be yours, tooÂ â€” you just need to open your eyes. The problem with hunting awe â€” like really hunting it, much like stalking prey â€” is that you often find yourself up against unpredictable weather, harsh elements of cold and heat, your own exhaustion and frequent disappointment. After all, there are no real guarantees in nature; you can't pay someone to make a rainbow appear â€” even though they are more frequent in some parts of the worldÂ â€”Â let alone a double rainbow, which is a miracle. You can't command a turtle to appear in the open ocean, an eagle to soar past, a moonflower cactus to bloomÂ or bioluminescence to sparkle. But much of the fun is in just trying, and luck favours those who turn up and devote time to their quests. Which is how I found myself standing on Goat's Beach on the South Arm Peninsula near Hobart at midnight, straining to see the Aurora Australis â€”Â the Southern Lights â€”Â against a star-strewn sky. With me was my friend, expert of all things glowing and marine scientist Lisa Gershwin and her companion, a fluffy white dog of Madagascan heritage called Tui. As we stepped onto the sand, we both shouted with excitement when we saw the waves curling neon blue:Â bioluminescence! Or little plankton milling about in an algae bloom, which glow when stirred by motion. People often made ridiculous noises, artless and happy, when struck by awe and I am the same, squawking and crying: ""Oh my God!"" I had gone to Tasmania with my producer Lou to film an episode of Compass called Awe Hunters, determined to find other people who also made the pursuit of awe part of their daily lives. We met with giant tree climbers in the Huon Valley, star gazers in a Blue Mountains national park, group-choir singers in Brisbane and my ocean swimming friends back in Sydney. Gerwshin runs the ""Glow Show"" in Hobart where, armed with a UV light, she shows people how to find out which everyday objects like spinach juice and detergent glow. Her open, unabashed joy is charming and infectious, and she has a knack of looking at things differently, showing us that the everyday is often the extraordinary. She is also a hoot:Â as we ripped around Hobart in her red convertible Tabasco â€”Â so named ""because it's red, hot and a little bit saucy"" â€” my stomach hurt from laughing. But that night on the beach, waiting for hours on the shore bitten by winter winds, we slowly began to freeze. I was cursing myself for wearing cowboy boots with thin socks on the bottom. Lisa was hobbling about in some pain, suffering from an unfortunate incident involving trying to cut her big toenail with garden shears (something she now recommends against), and yanking it off instead. We had already been to a couple of places, and seen nothing. But we huddled, stared into the sky and employed the dog as a hot water bottle. Lisa even convinced me to do a slightly awkward ""aurora dance"" (the awkward was me, not her) which basically involved a lot of jazz hands (again me, not her). Then, it appeared. A peach smudge of light, ringed with gold. With the help of a time lapse, we saw it in its full, spectacular contrast and whooped with delight. With blue-lit waves underneath â€”Â a double dazzler â€” what are the chances? AWE. I could drink it all day but I'd probably keel over drunk with excitement. I love the way you feel when you're awe-struck. Goosebumps, tingling, giddy, laughing, sometimes crying, you feel intoxicated but instead of the sodden hangover, you return to life lifted up, expanded, content. Awe is something not easy to define, but usually involves stopping in your tracks, being amazed by something and, often, feeling small against the full scale of the universe. In recent years, mounting scientific evidence has shown what we have instinctively known for millennia â€”Â that experiencing awe makes us happier, healthier, kinder and more connected to each other. And experiencing it together, in an experience social scientists call collective effervescence â€” in an event like the brilliant Pub Choir, a Matildas game, or mass rallyÂ â€”Â can be wildly restoring. Like someone had ""poured liquid gold"" into your soul, said one devotee of pub choir. I like to think of Dacher Keltner, professor of psychology at the University of California, as the godfather of awe. He's been studying it for decades and has recently published a book called Awe: The New Science of Everyday Wonder and How It Can Transform Your Life. He says a key to awe is sheer perspective: ""When you feel awe around vast trees or under the ocean like you've experienced or looking at a night sky or â€¦ listening to a choir, whatever it may be, you kind of feel â€¦ small and insignificant and humble."" Keltner says he's done lots of studies showing that ""when you go out by big trees, when you see big views, when you listen to inspiring music, when you watch nature videos, it tends to kind of quiet down the ego"". ""It makes yourself seem small, your concerns seem small, your stresses seem less significant,"" he says. ""Today a lot of young people and a lot of people in general are focusing too much on the self. And awe takes us out of that focus, gets us to open our eyes to the world outside us."" The Huon Valley's Grove of Giants â€”Â so named by tree climber Steve Pearce and his crew â€”Â is home to some of the world's largest trees. When Pearce began climbing them he was blown away by their magnificence and felt an urge to protect them â€”Â which he realised he might be able to do by sharing them with others. He began taking huge composite portraits of trees like blue gum Lathamus Keep which, at 80 metres, is the biggest in the grove. He also started bringing members of the public into the forest. ""It was kind of like this journey that wasn't a choice,"" Pearce says. ""Being able to share that experience with someone who's right beside you, it's incredible. ""I believe that I've experienced something that's so life-changing â€¦ so why not get as many people up there as you can to affect that change in them?"" I have discovered the astounding comfort awe can provide in my own life when enduring chronic health problems, gruelling surgeries and other granite hurdles life has thrown onto my path. I have, mostly, slipped on goggles and slid into the ocean to find refuge in the silence, in the wonder of the world contained under the surface and the thrilling sightings of turtles, sharks and various luminous creatures. The ocean has saved me and kept me sane. After I wrote a book called Phosphorescence about finding solace in awe and wonder, I was swamped by letters from people telling me that they had felt that way tooÂ â€”Â that it is the wonder, experiencing the tiny delights and booming thunders in nature when they were most at peace, and that by training themselves to look for awe every day, or week, their lives had been transformed. We had learned how toÂ â€”Â albeit briefly â€”Â shed the stresses and distractions of our days and immerse ourselves in amazement by paying attention to the world. It's like a stunning secret that we can all share in, and thrive on, once we know how to, and why, we do it. It's not about expensive holidays, or adrenaline-busting escapades, but seeking out places to walk or swim, or wonder, keeping an eye trained to look for small miracles in local parks, or garden beds. Sometimes just showing up is uneventful, but it makes the moments when you spy something spectacular even more brilliant. Awe is all around us â€”Â we just need to look for it. And it changes you. As Keltner says: ""Brief experiences of awe open your eyes to what we call meaning in psychology, which is like the core thing that you care about in life, right? Like, maybe you care about preserving the environment or bringing justice to the world, or painting beautiful things. Awe makes you realise what you really care about. And that's transformative â€¦ it shifts us out of this very narrow view of ourselves to an expanded transformed sense of who we are."" Gershwin decided to share it, in her Glow Shows in Hobart, because, she says, ""there's a lot of things that are really distressing going on in the world â€¦ war, famine, disease ...Â Taxes are going up, prices are going up, values going down. Quality of serenity is going down."" And she believes people want an escape: ""I want an escape. I think we all need an escape. What better escape than wholesome nature that glows in the dark, that sucks in our mind, sucks in our heart, sucks in our gut, and makes us feel in many of our organs something extraordinary. I mean, awe has this full body experience that â€¦ makes you go [wow], and what better escape than awe?"" Back on Goat's Beach, our feet thoroughly numb, we shuffled up the sand, grinning at each other and laughing, thrilled to have seen something so spectacular, thrilled to have experienced it together, thrilled to be alive.

ir46,"The campaign for the referendum on the Voice is off and away. At issue is the inclusion in the constitution of 92 new words, which would recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians as the first peoples of this nation, and install a new advisory body called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. You can vote Yes, or you can vote No. You can't have one bit without the other; either you approve all 92 words, or you don't. Already, however, the public debate around those 92 words has grown like an invasive weed, generating ill-will and dispute over issues that are far removed from the question at hand. How many pages isÂ the Uluru Statement? Are you sick of having acknowledgements of country ""shoved down your throat""? Should Australia Day be changed? Is it racist to vote No? When people say they're ""confused"", it's not because they're stupid. It's because there are literally two cases sloshing about for Yes. The first is that the constitutional change is modest and won't do much. The second is that it will be a powerful force for improving the lives of Indigenous Australians. Here was the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese this week, advancing the first argument: ""This will not impact most Australians directly, but it might just make life better for the 3 per cent of Australians who happen to be the most disadvantaged group â€” the First Nations people,"" he said. ""I think it will be a moment where we can show respect to them; where we can feel better about ourselves as well as a nation and where the world can look at us and say, 'Australia is a mature, grown-up nation'."" ""Might just?"" That's pretty thin gruel for an urgent constitutional change. But the PM knows that there are also two NoÂ cases. There's the Opposition's argument that the Voice is a dangerously radical proposition that would gum up the works of government and the courts. And then there's Independent Senator Lidia Thorpe's argument that the Voice should be opposed because it's utterly toothless. No wonder there's confusion. And the PM's decision to characterise the Voice as a change that will make us feel better, and ""might just"" improve the lives of First Nations people â€“ well. It tells you which NoÂ case he fears the most. As the campaign begins, it's worth having a look at why this referendum question has become so hopelessly ensnarled in undergrowth. And perhaps doing a spot of weeding. This is a contested referendum. There's a Yes campaign and a No campaign. We know that Australians do not rush into changing our constitution. So the first, most obvious and most powerful tactic for maximising the chances of a No vote is to muddy the water. Much is made of the halcyon days of 1967, when the nation came together and 90 per cent of us voted YesÂ for the 1967 referendum, a significant national turning point in the status of our First Peoples. Why was that change so simple, and why is this one so vexed? Well,Â in 1967 there wasn't a NoÂ campaign. And the detail of the actual constitutional change involved was significantly obscured from voters, or at the very least not outlined in detail. The most enduring campaign poster from 1967 featured a beautiful Aboriginal baby, with the slogan ""Right Wrongs: Write YES For Aborigines!"" Voting Yes, it was broadly indicated, would finally recognise First Nations people as Australians. The Yes campaign was vague on detail. It was feel-good. And most importantly, it was formally uncontested. And that's why, to this day, so few people know what, exactly, the 1967 referendum did. The most common misconceptions are that it gave Indigenous people the vote, or citizenship, or the right to be counted as humans in the Census instead of being considered flora and fauna. In fact, the 1967 referendum did two things. First: It empowered the federal government to makeÂ ""special laws"" for Indigenous Australians. Since Federation, section 51 of the Constitution had empowered the federal government to make special laws that affected only members of a certain race. It's known as ""the race power"". It was drafted specifically to allow the government to make discriminatory laws. And it's still there. But Indigenous Australians were expressly excluded from that section. Until the 1967 referendum removed the words in bold, section 51 empowered the government to make laws regarding ""the people of any race, other than the aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws"". Why were First Nations people carved out of this section in the first place? Opinions differ. Certainly, responsibility for Indigenous policy was thought to be a state and territory affair. Some argue that the long-term plan was for Aboriginal people to die out, and it was left to the states and territories to manage their decline. Either way, the claim that the currently proposed referendum would ""introduce race"" into our national document, or ""re-racialise"" the nation, is not correct. The power to make racially discriminatory laws has been there all along, and since 1967 it's been used since to make special laws for Indigenous people, ranging from the establishment of ATSIC and Aboriginal legal services to the 2007 Intervention in the Northern Territory. (Jane Lee put together a good piece for ABC's The History Listen, examining whether the race power should be abolished.) The second thing the 1967 referendum did was remove the Constitution's section 127, which decreed that ""Aboriginal natives should not be counted"" when calculating the number of people in the Commonwealth. This didn't mean they weren't previously counted in the census; they were. And please excuse the language in this next paragraph. ""Prior to 1967, censusÂ asked a question about Aboriginal race to establish numbers of 'half-castes' and 'full-bloods',"" reports this very handy research brief from the excellent folk at the Parliamentary Library. ""'Full-bloods'Â were then subtracted from the official population figure in accordance with the legal advice from the Attorney-General."" The ""official population figure"", for Commonwealth purposes, is much more important than a straight head-count. The population of each state is what's used to calculate various federal payments. It's also used to set electoral boundaries, and so on. So the failure to count Indigenous people in these calculations skewed all sorts of things, with particular ramifications for states and territories with larger First Nations populations. Even though there wasn't a No campaign for the 1967 referendum, there was plenty of racist commentary about. The Sydney Morning Herald, for instance, described the historic inclusion of Indigenous people in the census as ""a mildly entertaining historical oddity"" and opined that it was ""more difficult than rounding up a mob of wild brumbies"". What is the point of all this? Well, it's that as a nation we remember the 1967 referendum as simple, where in fact it was quite technical. If the Yes campaign in 1967 had been ""Vote Yes To Remove The Ban On Making Discriminatory Laws For Aboriginal People and Also To Fix A Nagging Administrative Matter In The Calculation Of Federal Payments And Electoral Boundaries"" â€“ how do you think it would have fared? No,Â they went for a cute baby and essentially a ""be nicer to Aboriginal people"" vibe. Oddly enough, the 2023 proposed constitutional amendment is actually easier to understand. Here it is: In recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Peoples of Australia: i. there shall be a body, to be called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice; ii. the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice may make representations to the Parliament and the Executive Government of the Commonwealth on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; iii. the Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws with respect to matters relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, including its composition, functions, powers and procedures. Read it carefully. You'll see that the proposed Voice ""may make representations"" to the parliament and to federal departments ""on matter relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples"". There isn't any mention of a veto power, or any obligation on the parliament or the bureaucracy to take â€“ indeed â€“ any notice of all. This is a fact. YesÂ proponent and Minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney has consistently argued that enshrining the Voice in the Constitution ensures that that Voice becomes a permanent feature of Australian governance and cannot be erased ""at the stroke of a pen"" by future governments. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton agrees, but he thinks that's a bad thing. ""If a Voice is embedded in the Constitution, the parliament can't change the Voice or pass laws to override it,"" he told the parliament in May, in a major speech outlining his reasons for voting No. But clause (iii) clearly empowers future governments to fiddle with the Voice's composition, powers and procedures. So a hostile future government could, say, reduce the membership of the Voice to one person, and park that person in a windowless room in Canberra without an internet connection, or take every recommendation from the Voice and file it straight into the recycling. Conversely, a different government might increase the membership. But what they can't do â€“ and this is important â€” is abolish the Voice entirely, or introduce an obligation to listen to the Voice and act on its recommendations. If any future government tried to legislate either of these things, the High Court would be obliged to strike down that legislation. Because it's inconsistent with the Constitution. That's how constitutional law works; the High Court chucks out legislation that doesn't accord with the spirit of what the Australian voting population has agreed to have enshrined in our national document. That's not opinion; it's a fact. The referendum on October 14 is a yes/no vote on the above 92 words. All other disputes should be shut out. Incendiary allegations of racism or poor faith are irrelevant. It doesn't matter if the Uluru Statement is one page or 1,000; the referendum is not inserting the Uluru Statement into the Constitution. It's about inserting those 92 words. It's nothing to do with the date of Australia Day or charging people to go to the beach or proving that Australia isn't racist. Don't get lost in the weeds.

ir47,"There are only aboutÂ 20 fluent speakersÂ left of Pertame, an Indigenous language also known asÂ Southern Arrente that'sÂ spoken south of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. Of the remaining speakers, most are elderly.Â  But at a local school, a new program is aiming to create a new generation of speakers and keep the language alive. Pertame School in Alice Springs has started running a 'language nest'Â â€” an immersive program, similar to a playgroup, in which mums and bubs come to the school four days a week to take part in activities and lessons. The classes are run entirely in Pertame, and there's only one rule â€” English is left at the door. ""We teach Pertame to the younger generation â€¦ so we can keep our language going strong,"" Shania Armstrong, who works at the school, said.Â  ""We want the next generation to be fluent speakers"". With the programÂ open toÂ childrenÂ aged zero to five,Â it's hopedÂ both the children and their parents will learn the language, and then continue speaking it at home. There are currently eight babies and their mothers taking part in the program, but the school also has a wider cohort of older students. ""We hope our language will be saved,"" Ms Armstrong said. With a majority of Australia's First Nations languagesÂ endangered,Â and only spoken by elders, teaching Indigenous languageÂ to young childrenÂ is a tactic being used by language advocates across Australia. The hope is toÂ raise multi-lingual kidsÂ who will carry on their language for years to come. InitiativesÂ underway across the countryÂ range fromÂ immersive school programsÂ to publishing children'sÂ books in traditional language,Â as highlighted atÂ the recent PULiiMA Indigenous Languages and Technology Conference. The Indigenous Literacy Foundation (ILF) hasÂ played a major role in the language push, working with First Nations communities to write, create and publish children'sÂ books in traditional languages.Â  They have already worked with more thanÂ 400 communities and published books in 30 different languages. Tictac Moore, a Tiwi woman and programs manager at the ILF, said children were more engaged in their learning when it involved books in their own languages. ""Kids are more likely to read books if they can relate to it,"" Ms Moore said. ""The books get them excited about their own culture"". The books published by ILF often have stories rooted in the characters, places or experiences ofÂ communitiesÂ such asÂ The Yakanarra Dogs, written by childrenÂ in the Central Kimberley,Â and Shordi KrikÂ (Shorty Creek), written byÂ Barunga children. The foundation also translatesÂ western books into Indigenous languages, such as the Very Hungry Caterpillar. Ms Moore said the books had alsoÂ helped non-Indigenous children learn First Nations words and phrases, asÂ schools around Australia increasingly introduced Indigenous language into the classroom. ""You get a lot of non-Indigenous mob who love these books, because they're still relatable, and they're still funny,"" Ms Moore said.Â  SheÂ said teaching children from a young age wasÂ vital toÂ keeping language alive. ""It's so they don't get lost in other things like technologyÂ and Western 'everything',"" she said. ""Start them off young so they're interested. ""If they get the language at a young age, and they keep with it, it sticks with them for life.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-03/indigenous-language-revival-program-pertame-alice-springs-nt/102802606
ir48,"The ultra-powerful James Webb Space Telescope has taken the clearest image of the M51Â galaxy in almost two decades.Â  A team of scientists at Stockholm university used the telescope to produce a clear image of the galaxy that exists millions of light years away from ours. M51 â€” also known as NGC 5194 â€” is located in the constellation Canes Venatici. In its latest press release on the galaxy, the European Space Agency (ESA) says it's about 27 million light-years away from Earth. It's stands out because,Â unlike other spiral galaxies that have jagged, incomplete arms,Â M51Â boast prominent, well-developed spiral arms like the ones showcased in this image. The galaxy is nicknamed the Whirlpool because of its swirling structure. Those swirling arms are actually long lanes of stars and gas laced with dust. M51 has been of particular interest for astronomers due to its tumultuous relationship with its neighbour, the dwarf galaxy NGC 5195. The gravitational pull of M51's smaller neighbour is thought to be partially responsible for M51's distinct spiral arms. The new M51 image was observed as a part of the wider project Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers â€”Â or FEAST. FEAST observations are trying to shed light on star formation and stellar feedback â€”Â or the amount of energy stars pour into environments that form them â€”Â in galaxies outside the Milky Way. Basically, FEAST is looking into how stars are formed. In the new M51 image,Â Â the dark red regions trace the filamentary warm dust permeating the medium of the galaxy. The red regions show the reprocessed light from complex molecules forming on dust grains, while colours of orange and yellow reveal the regions of ionised gas by the recently formed star clusters. Not really. That's because the image isn't a photograph. In fact, the image above is actually a series of separate exposures thatÂ were originally in grey scale and were beamedÂ back to Earth. They were taken using JWST's Near infrared Camera (NIRCam), which covers infrared wavelength range from 0.6 to 5 microns, andÂ Mid-InfraRed Instrument, which covers infrared wavelength range fromÂ 5 to 28 microns. The equipment allows astronomers to take pictures of very faint objects around a central bright object,Â a NASA fact sheet says.Â  It works by blocking out the brighter object's light, which makes it possible to capture the dimmer object nearby. ""Just like shielding the Sun from your eyes with an upraised hand can allow you to focus on the view in front of you,"" NASA explains.Â  Each image was taken usingÂ a different filterÂ to capture different wavelengths,Â and each filter has been assigned a different colour. The colour comes form layering all of these images on top of each other. The last time we saw this sharp an image of M51 was all the way back in 2005. It was taken with theÂ Advanced Camera for SurveysÂ aboard theÂ NASA/ESAÂ Hubble Space Telescope. Back then, ESA estimated the galaxy was 25 million light-years away. But it's unclear exactly how far away M51 is because those distances are far too long to measure with a ruler, so experts have to make educated guesses. A press release published by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 2022 said it was 30 million light-years away. An earlier NASA press release from 2017 said it was 30 million light-years away. Editor's Note 04/09/2023: This article has been updated to clarify the galaxy's distance from Earth is approximate and reflect varied estimates of its distance from ESA and NASA.",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-03/james-webb-telescope-whirlpool-galaxy-m51/102808584
ir49,"Rolf Gericke would rather die than be forced to part with his cats if he needs to moveÂ into an aged care facility. The 78-year-old has been living on his own with his four cats in Tasmania's south since his wife died a few years ago. ""I'd rather die than move into an aged care home without them,"" Mr GerickeÂ said. ""When I feel depressed or anything â€¦Â they seem to feel it and one of them always comes."" There are no aged care providers in his home state that will take him with his cats.Â  It's part of a wider problem â€” only one in five aged care homes in Australia will consider allowing pets, according to the Companion Animal Network Australia (CANA). CANA chief executive Trish Ennis says 86 per cent of people with pets in aged care settings experience improved mental and physical health.Â  ""If you can imagine moving into residential care anyway you're giving up your house you're giving up everything to fit in one room,"" she said. ""It's a very depressing, hard time to go through, but to give up your best friend and companion along with that, and god knows where that pet's going to go."" ""I've got people that are staying at home and risking health and their lives because they don't want to lose their pet, rather move into residential care where they can get all the support in the world."" Mr Gericke has some health issues and receives a check-in call. ""I get the Red Cross call every morning whether I'm still alive."" Aged care homes are faced with many tough issues, and deciding whether or not to have pets is normally a case-by-case task with most denied.Â  Glen Hardwick, chief executive of Christian Homes Tasmania, says that pets are not allowed because the risk to residents and staff is too high.Â  ""It's a lot more complex because of the frailty of the individuals as they deteriorate in their ageing process,"" he said. ""As much as we'd love to enable our residents in the residential care to bring their pets in, the risks to them, our staff and other residents is too high."" ""[There are]Â multiple reasons about hygiene, looking after the pet, litter trays, the smell, the residents walking the halls without any trip hazards."" While residents in Tasmanian residential care are not allowed to own pets, four-legged creatures walk the halls often as part of pet therapy. One carer even brings in a sheep which walks the halls andÂ only sometimes leaves behind little messes. ""The interaction with the residents is very clearly to their benefit both emotionally and physically,"" Mr Hardwick said. A budgie owned by Debra Turnbull is the only residential animal so far allowed by Christian Homes. ""It makes it a bit more homey,"" she said. ""I like it when Cathy brings the animals in, one of the other carers brings their little dog in which I look after for a couple hours and just have a good time."" In Victoria, aÂ group of aged care homes not only allows pets, but encourages people to bring their pets with them. ""At the moment across our four homes we have eight to 10 petsÂ â€¦ it ebbs and flows depending on the resident population,"" said Lifeview chief executive Samatha Jewell. There are a few rules to having a pet, including having leads when outside the bedroom and having a family or a representative agree to take itÂ in an emergency. ""The resident must be able to care for that pet because our staff aren't there to care for pets, they've got plenty on their plates,"" Ms Jewell said. ""The family and the representative â€¦Â must agree to assist and to take that pet home because we don't want any pet dumping."" Ms Jewell says she has noticed a significant difference when a resident brings in their pet.Â  ""They settle in quicker â€¦ remain more independent because you're still caring for that pet so you do get up to feed it or walk the dog,"" she said. ""It's better for their mental health and wellbeing and it also benefits the other residents because they get to enjoy that pet as well."" Ms Jewell has worked closely with CANA'sÂ Trish Ennis to incorporate pets into aged care homes safely and to educate other providers on their policies and procedures. ""A major problem a lot of the residential care places have is a lack of education,"" Ms Ennis said. RolfÂ Gericke hopes that more aged care facilities will consider pets. ""It would make it easier I believe for a lot of people that have no other option than ending up in a nursing home.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-03/elderly-risking-health-to-stay-with-pets/102774684
ir50,"Sometimes, the moments that go the most viral are also the most difficult to watch. Footage of US senator Mitch McConnell, 81, seizing up at a press conference â€“ for the second time in about a month â€“ makes for painful viewing. It happenedÂ not long after fellow veteran senator Dianne Feinstein made headlines for a string of seemingly senile episodes, which started when she returned from extended sick leave and insisted she hadn't been away. In the US, the ""senior moments"" from senior lawmakers keep on coming. And they're feeding a national conversation that doesn't bode well for the oldest president in history, who many voters have already written off as too elderly to re-elect. ""I think that the Mitch McConnell situation hurts Joe Biden more than it hurts the Republican Party,"" Republican pollster and Bellwether Research president Christine Matthews said. ""Mitch McConnell is about the same age as Joe Biden. ""So when you see somebody like Mitch McConnell freezing up, having these problems, I think it â€¦ puts pressure on [Mr Biden] to address the age issue."" Mr Biden hopes to be voted back in next year, aged 81,Â for a term that would keep him in the White House until he's 86. But polling on the question of age consistently returns poor results for the current commander-in-chief,Â while his likely challenger â€”Â a 77-year-old Donald Trump â€”Â avoids being judged as harshly. An AP-NORC poll this week revealed 77 per cent of respondents believe Mr Biden is too old to effectively serve another term. For Mr Trump, that figure is 51 per cent. One finding is particularly concerning for the president: the words people most associate with him are 'old', 'outdated', 'ageing' and 'elderly'. As Ms Matthews puts it: ""He has old man vibes."" Last year, Donald Trump declared that life begins at 80. But in the same social media post, he mocked Joe Biden for being ""one of the oldest 79s in history"". Since then, he's continued to attack Mr Biden by portraying him as doddering and weak, recently suggesting he couldnâ€™t even lift a beach chair. The president's political opponents often point to his speaking stumbles as evidence he's deteriorating into dementia. But Elaine Kamarck, a political scientist at the Brookings research institute, said he was being punished for having a life-long stutter. ""Sometimes his speech gets a little lilted, because he is still working on the stuttering problem,"" said Dr Kamarck, a Democrat who has worked on multiple presidential campaigns. She believes he needs to increase the amount of time he spends out and about â€”Â both performing presidential duties and simply being out in public â€”Â or the attacks will continue to be effective. ""They [Republicans] are going to be talking about age a lot,"" Christine Matthews said.Â  ""They know that that is Joe Biden's number one vulnerability."" During a radio interview after his 80th birthday, Mr BidenÂ said: ""IÂ can'tÂ even say that number, 80... I no more feel that than I'd get out from behind this desk and fly."" He now frequently jokes about his age. At a Black History Month event in February, he told the crowd: ""I look back on my career of 280 years."" In June, he told an Air Force Academy class: ""When I was graduating from high school 300 years agoÂ I applied to the Naval Academy."" Donald Trump is careful to distinguish age from acuity when attacking JoeÂ Biden, aware some of his Republican rivals are also turning the issue of age onto him. Nikki Haley, who recently described the US Senate as America's ""most privileged nursing home"", is pitching for the Republicans' presidential nominationÂ on a platform of generational change. And she wants ""mandatory mental competency tests"" for politicians over 75. The problem with that proposal, medical experts say, is there are no good tests for mental competency. ""They don't exist,"" said Art Kramer, the director of the CentreÂ for Cognitive and Brain Health at Boston's Northeastern University. ""The American military for many years has used a test to predict how somebody would fare in different professions. ""And you know, that does OK. But to predict something as complex as being a US senator or a president of a major country, I know of no such tests."" Others have been calling for age caps on political positions. There are minimum ages for running for the US House of Representatives (25), Senate (30), and president (35). This week's AP-NORC poll found about two thirds of people think maximum ages should also be introduced. Dr Kramer believes that would be a mistake. ""As we get older, memory tends to decline to some degree, how quickly we can respond tends to decline, but there are huge individual differences,"" he said. The 2024 election campaign won't be the first to put Joe Biden's age under a spotlight. In a 2020 Democratic presidential debate, Californian congressman Eric Swalwell pushed JoeÂ Biden to ""pass the torch"" onto someone younger. The 42-year-old now says he's been ""proven wrong"" by a president whose priorities have included gun control, climate change and student loan reform. Mr Swalwell still wants to see more younger politicians, and founded the Future Forum group of young Democrats with that goal. But sees big societal barriers to generational change in Congress. ""Childcare is one of the biggest obstacles to getting young people into politics, which is that it's so expensive,"" Mr Swalwell told the ABC. ""Doing this job is so disruptive on the family, but those are the people I think we really need right now [because] the issues of the young family, there's too many that are unaddressed."" It's a problem not exclusive to US Congress, and many Australian politicians have left politics after finding it incompatible with family life. But while the average age in Australia's parliament hovers around 50, inÂ Congress, it's 59.2. In the US Senate, it's 65. No current Australian federal MP is as old as Mr Biden. The closest is Queensland MP Bob Katter, who atÂ 78 is just a touch older than Donald Trump. How severely age ravages an individual varies greatly from person to person. Some are spared many cognitive declines well into their 80s and beyond. Doctors refer to those people as 'super-agers'. A 2020 study published in the Journal on Active Aging found both Joe Biden and Donald Trump were likely to fit that category, which it defined as ""a subgroup of people that maintain their mental and physical functioning into late life and tend to live longer than the average person their age"". Elaine Kamarck believes that assessment is correct. ""They go hard â€¦ they're smart, they're making decisions, they work full-time jobs that would kill somebody else."" As for Mitch McConnell, he has been medically cleared to return to the Senate when it resumes session on Tuesday after its summer break. In a medical note released publicly, Congress physician Brian Monahan suggested Mr McConnell's ""occasional lightheadedness"" could be related to a concussion he sustained in March, or dehydration. Mr Biden, who calls Mr McConnell a friend, says the pair spoke on the phone after the freeze-up and he wasn't concerned about Mr McConnell's ability to do his job. Â  ""I'm confident he's going to be back to his old self,"" Mr Biden said.",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-03/us-ageing-politicians-mconnell-feinstein-biden-trump/102802482
ir51,"When David and Julie Bland's house burned down in 2017, they wanted to replicate the character and authenticity of their grand old Queenslander in their next home. But faced with the ever-increasing costÂ of materials and lengthy delays for trades, they turned their back on a rebuild and instead chose to relocateÂ a pre-built home to their block. ""It took us about a year and a half to find a suitable replacement, something that had a bit of a wow factor to it,"" David says. After finding their soon-to-be dream home, residing on a block in inner-city Brisbane, it was cut into large pieces, loaded onto a couple of trucks and transported to their block in Boonah, about 80 kilometres south-west of Brisbane, in the middle of the night.Â  ""It's a rigmarole to get it organised,"" David says. ""[But]Â at four o'clock in the morning, the two halves arrive, and they ... just loosely put it in place. David says that after a well-earnt rest, the crew returned to join the house together, in a ""fascinating"" process. The pairÂ estimate their second-hand home cost less than half of what it would have to rebuild using new materials, andÂ even accounting for the delay in finding the house, it took considerably less time than building from scratch. The Blands aren't alone in looking toÂ already-constructedÂ homes, but could this be a model solutionÂ for those struggling with the challenges and uncertainty plaguing the construction industry? Queensland business owner John Wright buys and sellsÂ houses destined for demolition â€” often from property developers â€” and relocates them for customers who want a pre-built home. He said he had seen a spike in demand from buyers in recent years. ""It's been the busiest I've ever been in my life,"" he says. ""And even now ... as interest rates go up, we've still seen a huge demand. ""There's a lot of reasons why, but there's definitely construction time framesÂ and also cost."" Mr WrightÂ said while the price of pre-built houses varied considerably depending on size and style, they were generally more affordable than people expected. ""[They're]Â affordable housing, it's generally cheaperÂ then going through a builder,"" he says. Mr Wright says a three-bedroom house in good condition could be purchased, moved and stumped for about $100,000 to $120,000. But there are other costs to keep in mind such as service connections, and fees for permits needed by your local council to move the house on site.Â  Mr Wright says anyone considering purchasing a pre-built home should check that the property meets current building codes and regulations.Â  That can be a particular challenge with older homes, as Rafaele and Rosemary discovered. The couple bought anÂ old Queenslander, 'Dorothy', privately and had it trucked from Ipswich to their eco-village in northern NSW. ButÂ when inspected against modern building standards, the home required additional work â€”Â and therefore funds â€”Â to bring it up to code. ""We've had about $70,000 worth of variations,"" Rosemary told ABC TV's Restoration Australia. ""Some of them because of problems that have been found, such as rotting bearers underneath the floorboards, and a problem with the fact that she's an old house and she's got to comply now with modern structural codes."" Like Rosemary and Rafaele, David and Julie Bland were inspiredÂ to save an existing home thatÂ might otherwise have been destined for landfill. ""We're quite appalled by the number of houses that get demolished,"" Julie says. ""Beautiful, strong houses that could live for another 100 years at least.Â  ""For us, that's a big factor."" One barrier to buying a pre-built home is the need to have a lot of expendable cash, as borrowing can be more challenging for home removal projects. And then, you'll need enough cash to secure the land for the house in the first place. House removals are also more popular in some states â€” like Queensland and WAÂ â€” than others, where common styles of homes may not be suitable for the relocation process. So, depending on the locations of your landÂ and your would-be dream home, transportation costs could be prohibitive to your plans.Â  The Housing Industry Association says those reasons, and the relatively small quantityÂ of homes fit to be moved, mean it's not a silver bullet for many of the challenges facing those wanting to build. ""It's unlikely to be a mainstream solution to the issues that we've had with access to building materials,"" Geordan Murray, the executive director of industry policy,Â said. ""It isn't practical forÂ every type of dwelling. For example, one of the most common construction methods is brick veneer homes built on a concrete slab, [and] obviouslyÂ that type of dwelling can't really be picked up and relocated somewhere else. ""In terms of addressing the overall housing supply problem, it's unlikely to have a material impact, it's just that the numbers are too small. ""But with that said, every additional house that we are able to build does provide some additional stock."" Mr Murray also noted that while using aÂ pre-built house might ease the demandÂ for building materials, it was unlikely to do the same for in-demand trades and labourers. ""In most circumstances where a home is relocated, it's likely that nearly all of the plumbing [will need] to be replaced as well,"" Mr Murray said. ""So it's unlikely to remove the requirement for plumbing trades. ""Similarly for electrical trades, particularly an older home. [It]Â is likely to need re-wiring to meetÂ contemporary standards."" Even though it may not be a quick fix to the industry's woes, Mr Murray said it was great to see people thinking of ways to reuse buildings, rather than ripping them down. ""Demolishing a house does create a lot of waste soÂ making betterÂ use of recycled building materials is something that industry's improving on and as we move further towards a circular economy that's going to become a bigger issue,"" he said.

ir52,"Albury man Josh Docking didn't know what sleep deprivation was until he became a dad.Â Â  ""The constant lack of sleep was the hardest part, initially,"" he said. But being a father often takes more than just a physical toll. One in 10Â Australian fathers â€” that's about 30,000 men each year â€” experienceÂ perinatal depression. And those in rural and regional areas are even more vulnerable,Â due to a lack of professional and informal support services. But a new research project aims to help expectant dads navigate the ups and downs of fatherhood, well before their babies'Â due dates. For Mr Docking, fatherhood came at a time of significant change. ""We moved back to the regions five years ago, just before we had our firstborn,"" he said. ""For us, we were blessed to have a supportive family and some connections in the area. But we'd moved away for almost a decade, so it was still difficult."" Mr Docking saidÂ many regional dads lacked the kind of community he had. ""Especially if they were the only one in their friendship group who had a newborn baby, they were unintentionally ostracised because they weren't able to catch up after work or go away for a weekend, like they may have been able to previously,"" he said. That prompted Mr Docking to set up the Dads of Albury-Wodonga Facebook group in 2018, which has helped more than 230 local dads connect through coffee catch-ups and late-night conversations. ""I knew some other friends who were also becoming dads, and I wanted to connect and learn from them about what it's like to be a father â€¦ because for me it was really stepping into the unknown,"" Mr Docking said. ""But it was there that I began to meet other new dads who actually had nothing else in terms of support."" One of them was Wodonga-based dad Blair Keeble. ""When we had our first two kids, my wife could have one kid while I handled the other â€” but when the third came along, it was very overwhelming,"" he said. ""I knew Josh previously and he invited me along to the dads' group. It was just dads catching up at a playground, and the beauty of that was realising my situation wasn't unique."" Dad-specific support networks are few and far between, especially in regional and rural areas. While tech-based support initiatives like the Dadbooster and SMS4Dads are helping fill this gap, research shows it can be hard to provide new dads with the support they need. Associate Professor Jacqui Macdonald is a leading researcher on paternal perinatal mental health from Deakin University's Centre for Social and Early Emotional Development (SEED). ""We know from systematic reviews that more than half of the interventions used to support men in the early stages of fatherhood actually don't reduce symptoms of depression or anxiety,"" she said. Dr Macdonald saidÂ a major reason for this wasÂ the lack of research specifically addressing paternal perinatal mental health. ""By far, the majority of those interventions were developed for women, and then have been applied to men,"" she said. ""And what we know is, men often experience their mental health symptoms in different ways through risk-taking behaviour, substance misuse, or even avoidance strategies like staying at work for longer or spending hours on the internet."" That's where the ""1 in 10 men""Â project comes in. Earlier this month, Dr Macdonald and her SEED colleagues received $890,000 to study ways to reduce mental ill-health among new fathers. ""We know one in 10 men experience psychological distress across the early years of fatherhood â€” and there are 300,000 babies born each year in Australia,"" Dr Macdonald said. ""So that means 30,000 Australian fathers face some sort of mental health problem in the first year or few years of their infant's life. ""What we want to do is build an evidence base to inform how to prevent those mental health problems wherever we can."" She said the project would have three main stages: The project isÂ part of an international push to prioritise pre-conception health, which aims to support parents even before they consider having a child. But Dr Macdonald saidÂ greater focus must be placed on prospective fathers. ""We find more than 80 per cent of men who have mental health problems in the early stages of fatherhood have had a history of mental health problems, either through adolescence or young adulthood,"" she said. ""However, the research also suggests that if you can intervene in adolescence, positive mental health outcomes are more likely to be carried forward into the perinatal period."" Dr Macdonald saidÂ a key aim of the 1 in 10 men project was to increase social connectedness among new and soon-to-be dads. ""Essentially we want to create thisÂ whole community and infrastructure of supportive environments across young men's life-spans, so they're connected to support years before they enter into fatherhood,"" she said. Mr Keeble agreedÂ it wasÂ never too early to prepare for fatherhood. ""There's a lot of unknowns even before your baby arrives, so I think that's where the focus needs to start,"" he said. And Mr Docking saidÂ dads themselves couldÂ help champion paternal mental health. ""Anything preventative is what we need to be working towards,"" he said. ""So I just want to encourage new fathers to start their own little dads groups. That way we'll have those intentional communities of support popping up around the country.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-03/deakin-university-paternal-mental-health-research-new-dads/102800104
ir53,"EvenÂ before COVID-19,Â social isolation and lonelinessÂ were all too common across the community. Living among millions of other people is no comfort for people in cities, where the pace of life is often hectic, and technology and digitisation often limit, rather than help with, social interaction. The pandemicÂ amplified these problems. In its wake, more of us report we're lonely. For some, a weekly shopping trip may be the only chance to interact with others. A supermarket chain in the Netherlands is helping to combat loneliness with so-called ""slow"" checkouts where chatting is encouraged. Could a similar approach work here? Around a third of Australians report feeling lonely.Â One in sixÂ experience severe loneliness. According to the annual Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, peopleÂ aged 15 to 24Â report the greatest increase in social isolation over the past 20 years and the highest rates of loneliness. AnotherÂ Australian surveyÂ found men aged 35 to 49 had the highest levels of loneliness. Loneliness and social isolation areÂ not the same. Social isolation is a matter of how often we have contact with friends, family and others, which can be measured. Loneliness is more subjective. It describes how we feel about the ""quality"" of our interactions with others. Technology isÂ contributingÂ toÂ high rates of loneliness. Instead of meaningful face-to-face interactions, many of us now rely on social media, phone apps and video calls to socialise. We're also working longer hours, often at home. And due to the cost of living, many of us are choosing to stay home and save money, rather than eat out or go to ""the local"". It isn't only in Australia where this is happening. In the UK, aroundÂ 3.9 million older peopleÂ say television is their main company. Half a million may go five or six days a week without seeing anyone. The World Health OrganisationÂ recognisesÂ loneliness and social isolation as public health issues and priorities for policymakers. These issues seriously affect people's mental and physical health as well as longevity. The impacts are comparable with otherÂ risk factorsÂ such as smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity and not being physically active. For many, a visit to the supermarket may be the only time they interact with others. Sadly, increased use of technology, including self-serve checkouts, and cashiers tasked with speedily processing customers can make it challenging to have a conversation. Four years ago, the Netherlands' second-largest supermarket chain,Â Jumbo, introduced or ""chat checkout"". It's for shoppers who want to chat and aren't in a hurry. Recognising loneliness was an issue for many, the idea was to increase social interaction between customers and staff by slowing things down and encouraging conversation. Jumbo's chief commercial officer, Colette Cloosterman-van Eerd,Â explained: ""Many people, especially the elderly, sometimes feel lonely. As a family business and supermarket chain, we are at the heart of society. Our shops are an important meeting place for many people, and we want to play a role in identifying and reducing loneliness."" The first Kletskassa, in Vlijmen in Brabant, was so successful the family-owned company started rolling out slow checkouts inÂ 200 of its stores. Not only were customers responding positively, the concept also appealed to Jumbo's employees. They are trained to recognise signs of loneliness and come up with local initiatives to combat social isolation. Cloosterman-Van Eerd said: ""We are proud our staff want to work the chat checkout. They really want to help people and make contact with them. It's a small gesture but it's a valuable one, particularly in a world that is becoming more digital and faster."" The original focus of Jumbo's initiative was older shoppers. However, the trial showed people of all ages were keen to use the Kletskassa. The desire for human interaction didn't change across age groups. So, these ""chatty"" checkouts are open to anyone who will benefit from social connection. Some Jumbo stores also have anÂ All Together Coffee Corner, where locals can enjoy a coffee and chat with neighbours and volunteers who alsoÂ help outÂ with shopping and gardening. The Netherlands' government is partnering with a range of organisations, local government and companies to come up with solutions to combat loneliness across the country. Some 50 per cent of the 1.3 million people over 75 report they regularly feel lonely. Jumbo's initiatives are part of the Health Ministry'sÂ One Against LonelinessÂ campaign. In the 1980s, sociologist Ray Oldenberg coined the termÂ ""third place""Â â€” a place that's not home (the ""first place"") and not work (the ""second place""). Third places are familiar public spaces where people can connect over a shared interest or activity. Libraries, coffee shops, book stores, community gardens, churches, gyms and clubs are examples of third places. They all provide the opportunity for close proximity, interaction and often serendipitous conversations with other people we might not usually meet. KletkassaÂ have helped thousands of people, of all ages and backgrounds, by providing a few minutes of kindness and conversation. Imagine what could be achieved if our supermarkets offered their own version of the ""slow checkout"" for anyone who's in need of a chat to brighten their day. The first chain to introduce this sort of initiative in Australia would have a solid advantage over competitors through differentiation and prioritising customers. At the same time, it would make a small but meaningful contribution to improving social wellbeing. Challenge extended!

ir54,"Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the sight of clutter and mess in your home? Have you walked in the door only to feel overloaded by scattered papers, unwashed dishes and clothes in disarray? Maybe you've even had arguments because it bothers you more than it bothers you partner or housemates. You're not alone. Many people report a messy house can trigger feelings of stressÂ and anxiety So why do clutter and chaos make some of us feel so overwhelmed? Here's what the research says â€“ and what you can do about it. When we're surrounded by distractions, our brains essentially become battlegroundsÂ for attention. Everything competes for our focus. But the brain, as it turns out, prefersÂ order and ""singletasking"" over multitasking. Order helps reduce the competition for our attention and reduces mental load. While some people might be better than others at ignoring distractions, distracting environments can overload our cognitive capabilities and memory. Clutter, disorder and mess can affect more than just our cognitive resources. They're also linked to our eating, productivity, mental health, parenting decisions and even our willingness to donate money. Research suggests the detrimental effects of mess and clutter may be more pronounced in women than in men. One studyÂ of 60 dual-income couples found women living in cluttered and stressful homes had higher levels of cortisol (a hormone associated with stress) and heightened depression symptoms. These effects remained consistent even when factors like marital satisfaction and personality traits were taken into account. In contrast, the men in this study seemed largely unaffected by the state of their home environments. The researchers theorised that women may feel a greater responsibility for maintaining the home. They also suggested the social aspect of the study (which involved giving home tours) may have induced more fear of judgement among women than men. We will all live with clutter and disorganisation to some degree in our lives. Sometimes, however, significant clutter problems can be linked to underlying mental health conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, hoarding disorder, major depressive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and anxiety disorders. This raises a crucial question: which came first? For some, clutter is the source of anxiety and distress; for others, poor mental health is the source of disorganisation and clutter. It's important to remember clutter isn't all bad, and we shouldn't aim for perfection. Real homes don't look like the ones in magazines. In fact, disorganised spaces can result in increased creativityÂ and elicit fresh insights. Living in constant disorder isn't productive, but striving for perfectionism in cleanliness can also be counterproductive. Perfectionism itself is associated with feeling overwhelmed, anxiety and poor mental health. It's important to remember you have some agency over what matters to you and how you want to prioritise your time. One approach is to try to reduce the clutter. You might, for example, have a dedicated de-cluttering session every week. This may involve hiring a cleaner (if you can afford it) or playing some music or a podcast while tidying up for an hour with your other household members. Establishing this routine can reduce clutter distractions, ease your overall mental load and alleviate worry that clutter will spiral out of control. You can also try micro-tidying. If don't have time for a complete clean-up, commit just five minutes to clearing one small space. If the clutter is primarily caused by other household members, try to calmly discuss with them how this mess is affecting your mental health. See if your kids, your partner or housemates can negotiate some boundaries as a household over what level of mess is acceptable and how it will be handled if that threshold is exceeded. It can also help to develop a self-compassionate mindset. Mess doesn't define whether you are a ""good"" or ""bad"" person and, at times, it may even stimulate your creativity. Remind yourself that you deserve success, meaningful relationships and happiness, whether or not your office, home or car is a mess. Take comfort in researchÂ suggesting that while disorganised environments can make us susceptible to stress and poor decision-making, your mindset can buffer you against these vulnerabilities. If clutter, perfectionism or anxiety has begun to seem unmanageable, talk with your GP about a referral to a psychologist. The right psychologist (and you may need to try a few before you find the right one) can help you cultivate a life driven by values that are important to you. Clutter and mess are more than just visual nuisances. They can have a profound impact on mental wellbeing, productivity and our choices. Understanding why clutter affects you can empower you to take control of your mindset, your living spaces and, in turn, your life.

ir55,"A jury hasÂ been told a man who gave inconsistent evidence was not the ""sharpest knife in the drawer"", but was not the killer of a Hunter Valley toddler. Jordan William Thompson was 21 months old when he died in a Singleton unit in March 2005. A post-mortem examination found a lethal amount of the anti-depressant Endep in the toddler's system. Cecil Patrick Kennedy, then the boyfriend of the toddler's mother, Bernice Swales, has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter. Closing arguments are underway in the trial that has been running for more than two months in Sydney's Downing Centre District Court. In her closing address on Monday, Crown prosecutor Kate Nightingale said Mr Kennedy used the anti-depressant to sedate Jordan, as he disliked crying and became anxious aroundÂ fussyÂ infants. In her closing address on Tuesday, defence barrister Linda McSpedden said it was not in dispute the infant ingested a tablet that day, but rejected claims Mr Kennedy gave it to the boy. ""It cannot be denied that the child ingested that tablet and clearly the tablets were prescribed to the accused and were in his apartment,"" she said. ""The accused has denied strenuously ever giving a tablet to the child. ""Clearly on the evidence the tablet was ingested at least in the morning or mid morning. ""The accused was not the only person in the house and there was the opportunity for the [child's]Â mum to give the child the tablet."" Ms McSpedden said there was also a possibility Jordan came across a tablet in the unit. Ms McSpedden told the jury Mr Kennedy took part in several interviews and gave inconsistent evidence to detectives. ""You might form the view he is certainly not the sharpest knife in the drawer,"" she said. ""There were some inconsistencies and there were incidents where he did lie to police."" She also talked about Mr Kennedy juggling lovers, including Jordan's mother and another woman who lived in his unit block. ""He certainly wasn't too bright in the way he conducted his romantic liaisons,"" she said. Ms McSpedden asked the jury to consider all of the evidence in context and not to pre-judge Mr Kennedy. ""I have got no doubt he [the judge]Â will tell you, in order to find [a person]Â guilty you have to find that guilt proven beyond reasonable doubt,"" she said. ""That is very easy to lose in a case that has got so much circumstantial evidence and where your are tempted to either be Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot. ""It is not a guessing game and what is to be proven which is different to a detective game is that the crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/cecil-kennedy-alleged-manslaughter-jordan-thompson-singleton/102815282
ir56,"At just 21, Lauren Brockhurst is one of the youngest ringers at Isis Downs Station in outback Queensland, but there's little she can't do. ""I love the diversity. Each day you get up, and there's something different to do,"" she said. She came to the sprawling cattle and goat station from the Sunshine Coast in early 2023, following her father and grandfather's footsteps into the industry. Studying at university or getting a ""normal"" job was never on the cards. ""You'll have really hard days and you're like, 'What am I doing here?' But then you think about people working in an office every day,"" she said. ""This is really rewarding."" Once considered a man's job, many say the number of women working on stations in Australia is rising â€” but it's a different story across the broader agriculture sector. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicatesÂ the agriculture sector is still largely dominated by men. Women make up just one-third of the industry â€”Â a figure that'sÂ stayed the same since 1998. Globally, womenÂ only make up 33.5 per cent of meat workers, down 36 per cent, according to the latest Meat Business Women's Gender Representation report. And only 8 per cent of chief executive roles in the industry are held by women, according to the report. Despite this, for the first time in the history of Isis Downs, women currentlyÂ make up half the stock camp of 14 ringers, takingÂ on the burden of responsibility for day-to-day operations. Anna and Andrew Cochrane have managed the station for the Consolidated Pastoral Company (CPC) for seven years. Ms Cochrane said there hadÂ been a great sense of empowerment for women in agriculture in the past two decades. ""There's nothing that women can't do on a station anymore,"" she said. Both the head stockperson and weaner supervisor at Isis Downs are women, andÂ each are eying up futures as station managers. ""It's not what gender you are, it's how good you are at your job and how passionate you are about it,"" Ms Cochrane said. Ms Cochrane said the station preferencedÂ personality styles and work ethic over gender quotas but that there were qualities women generally brought to the job over men. ""We do a lot of work in the mental health space, and women are probably more able to express their feelings,"" she said. ""They bring a greater attention to detail â€¦ and tend to be a bit more mature."" Days at the sprawling 263,000-hectare station start at 6:00am sharp with breakfast at the homestead, a late start compared to other stations, according to the staff. Muddy shoes line the doorstep of the building, which resembles a school camp at times. By 6:30am, the ringers are out the door and onto the daily chores of feeding poddy animals, processing weaners in the cattle yards or servicing equipment. Piper Smith, a first-year ringer at the station, said it wasÂ ""awesome"" having so many girls around. ""They're like your best mates and your sisters,"" she said Ms Smith, 22, always had an interest in agriculture but never thought she wouldÂ work in the industry. It wasn't until she took a gap year as a governess on a cattle station that she decided to study agricultural science. ""It's very hard work some days,"" she said. ""But it's very rewarding â€¦ and you're working with a great crew and everyone's so supportive."" Life working on the land doesn't come without its challenges or stereotypes though. Previously, Kelly Shotton, 26, wasÂ used to being the only woman in the trade. She spent more than four years as an electrician, before deciding to try her hand on a station. ""I was always wanting to be outdoors â€¦Â those office jobs just sent me absolutely crazy,"" she said. ""There's so many different opportunities here that I didn't even know existed."" Among the Isis Downs ringers, Ms Shotton said the whole team learntÂ from each other's skills. ""You might be with one of the boys, and they've got the muscle,"" she said. ""You have to find those innovative ways to get around it."" Ms Brockhurst said when she started ringing, she heard a stereotype that women only came to stations to ""wear nice neck scarves and take cute photos"". ""Because of that comment, I never wore a neck scarf until this year because I didn't want to be part of that stereotype,"" she said. When it comes to stereotypes, Ms Shotton has a straightforward answer. ""At the end of the day, they're either jealous â€¦ it's something they can't do, or they wish they were in the position that you were,"" she said.Â  ""It's just the way the world's going now â€¦ so either grow with it or get out.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/isis-downs-station-50-per-cent-female-ringers-outback-queensland/102788276
ir57,"A representative of the Catholic Church hasÂ told a federal Senate inquiry that self-government in the ACT is not a right. Catholic Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn Chancellor Patrick McArdle made the comments in a public committee hearing into a bill, which would effectively compel the ACT government to hold an inquiry into its own acquisition of Calvary Public HospitalÂ earlier this year. The ACT government took control of the facilityÂ â€“ now known as the North Canberra Hospital â€“ from Calvary Health Care in July, with the intention of building a new $1 billion hospital at the site in the Canberra suburb of Bruce. The church and Calvary slammed the ACT government's decision, though a legal bid by the Catholic not-for-profit operator to stop the takeover was unsuccessful. In June, a private member's bill by Queensland LNP senator Matt Canavan was introduced,Â which would require the ACT government to conduct an inquiry into territory legislation enabling the acquisition.Â That bill was referred to the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. AtÂ the time, the ACT government accused the federal Coalition of trying to undermine territory rights. But Mr McArdle told the Senate committee the ACT wasÂ ""unique"" in the Commonwealth as the seat of government. ""It does not have the full range of state prerogatives,"" Mr McArdle said. ""It will therefore always be subject to additional levels of scrutiny from [federal] parliament. ""Self-government in the ACT is not a right â€“ it is a determination of this parliament. ""The archdiocese believes that more scrutiny is required of this decision, rather than less."" ACT Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith denied the government had sought to avoid scrutiny or due process in the Legislative Assembly for the bill enabling the government's takeover of the hospital. ""The bill was considered by the scrutiny committee and the government responded to the scrutiny committee's report prior to the bill being debated â€“ and indeed made an amendment to the bill in response to the committee's comments,"" she told the Senate committee. ""The bill was debated in the assembly and there was opportunity to put amendments to the bill, the government itself made a number of amendments in that debate and consideration in the detailed stage. ""The other relevant committees have always been free to undertake an inquiry and the ACT government has not sought to avoid scrutiny â€“ we have sought to manage a complex process with the least possible disruption to staff and to consumers in the ACT."" Ms Stephen-Smith said she thought most people in Canberra not only supported the decision but hadÂ also ""seen how smoothly it [had]Â gone"". ""Healthcare has continued to be delivered at North Canberra Hospital by the same staff, working in the same teams, with the same management, the same structure, delivering excellent care to the people of Canberra,"" she said. Calvary's regional chief executive Ross Hawkins told the committee he would not be drawn on what his organisation thought was an appropriate threshold for the Commonwealth to intervene in territory affairs. ""We're here to explain our story, and I really think it's up to parliament to determine where that threshold sits,"" Mr Hawkins said. ""We were an operator and a long-term partner of the ACT government, ...Â we'd worked with government closely for 34 years, we'd existed for 44 years. ""That was taken away from us in a matter we believe was not acceptable. ""It has been the most troubling time for our workforce. There were people crying on wards, going home."" Catholic vicar Tony Percy told the committee that non-government organisations around Australia were worried the ACT's takeover set a precedent, and they wanted ""written guarantees"" that other jurisdictions would notÂ seek to acquire the church's assets. ""What trust have we got and what else is being assured to us?"" he said. ""It's our intention to keep going beyond this inquiry to ensure every institution in the country â€“ federal, state and the territories is actually secure. ""We want written guarantees â€“ not just for the Catholic church, but for every institution whether it's religious or not. ""There's a lot of anxiety on this."" Mr McArdle said the church accepted the ACT government's assertion that the takeover was not motivated by Calvary's faith-based policies. ""However, we do need to reflect on the fact that there's an increasing disdain and antipathy towards people of faith as such in the civic operations of Canberra,"" he said. Ms Stephen-Smith insisted the efficiency of having both of the ACT's major public hospitals under the control of one operator and the need to provide more hospital beds for a rapidly growing city were at the centre of the government's decision. ""This was a very difficult decision, not one that we took lightly but one we ultimately felt that we had no choice but to make because could not reach an agreement with Calvary on a path forward, "" Ms Stephen-Smith said. ""We know from experiences where hospitals have transferred ownership interstate â€“ that have gone on for an extended period of time â€“ that that has been very disruptive to staff. ""The only people discussing these straw-man issues, such as abortion and voluntary assisted dying, have been those opposed to the acquisition. The government has never made or claimed such links."" Ms Stephen-Smith said Senator Canavan's bill was the thing the ACT government believed could setÂ a ""difficult precedent"". ""We believe the territory should have the same rights as states to make decision in the interest of its citizens,"" she said. ""The ACT has had self-government for more than 30 years, and to make the types of decisions what are the purview of states and territories without the interference of other parliaments we believe is an important element of self-government."" Calvary said a compensation amount for the takeover is yet to be determined.

ir58,"Federal Liberal leader Peter Dutton has become one of the key figures in the No campaign in the Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum. MrÂ Dutton has saidÂ the party supports constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians â€”Â and has pledged to hold a second referendum on that matterÂ if he wins government at the next election â€”Â but does not support a constitutionally enshrined consultative body. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese,Â has criticised the opposition's proposal for a second referendum as ""sabotage"". But Mr Dutton'sÂ view isn't shared by all of his state and territory party colleagues, including Australia's only Liberal premier â€” Tasmania's Jeremy Rockliff â€” who isÂ actively campaigning with LaborÂ to support a Yes vote. The VictorianÂ Liberal leader John Pesutto was the last to declare his position, yesterday announcing that he wouldÂ be voting No.Â  Here's what state and territory Liberal leaders have said about their personal positions on the Voice. While the NSW Liberal Party has agreed not to bind MPs to a position, its leaderÂ Mark SpeakmanÂ has thrown his personal support behind the Voice. ""IÂ think the potential rewards outweigh the potential risksÂ and I personally support a Voice in the Australian constitution,"" he previously said. He has suggested the government make changes to its proposal including adding a second question on the referendum â€” one on the matter of constitutional recognition and the other on the establishment of the voice. John Pesutto was the last of the party's leaders to announce his position on the Voice, announcing on Monday that he would vote No.Â  ""I believe the objective of the Voice can be achieved without constitutional change,"" he said.Â  He said governments at all levels should continue to improve their framework to engage Indigenous voices. ""We must all rally to advance the wider cause of reconciliation and unite to close those gaps in life outcomes which,Â to this day,Â deny so many First Nations people the dignity and equality of opportunity they deserve,"" he said.Â  Queensland's Opposition Leader David Crisafulli took time to weigh up the matter before saying he would notÂ be supporting the Voice. ""Having looked at the committee report, I'm just not convinced that is the best mechanism to deliver the change that's needed,"" he said. He won't be campaigning, but said he owed it to the people of QLD to be transparent and share his view. In South Australia, David Speirs said he was the first Liberal leader to state his position on the Voice nationally. While he'll be advocating for a No vote, he wants to see all campaigning done in a respectful way. ""I hope this referendum doesn't divide us,"" he previously told the ABC. He said ""the concept of the Voice dividing society along racial lines didn't fit with basic values of the Liberal Party"", which was why he would not support it. While on maternity leave earlier this year, Elizabeth Lee said she would not actively campaign but would be voting Yes. ""It is a recognition of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the first people of Australia and I think that is important to ensure that that is enshrined in our founding document,"" she said. Jeremy Hanson, who was acting opposition leader in Ms Lee's absence, took a different view,Â firmly declaring his intention to vote No. Libby Mettam backflipped on her stance in Western Australia. After originally supporting the Voice, she changed her position to a No vote, saying she wanted ""more detail"". ""What many Australian, and Western Australians, are hopeful of, is more detail on how the Voice â€” the Voice that has been proposed â€” will lead to some real practical outcomes,"" she said. She said she remained supportive of recognising First Nations Australians in the constitution. Jeremy Rockliff is Australia's only Liberal premier and, against his federal party position, he supports the Voice and will be voting Yes. ""Of course the way forward is to support the Voice, support the recognition of the constitution, consult with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, first nations people, united in a way forward,"" he said. When Mr Dutton announced his stance, Mr Rockliff said he would vigorously campaign for a Yes vote. ""While I don't agree with the federal position, my position as Premier of Tasmania is very clear,"" he said. That position was underscored on the first full day of campaigning in the referendum, when Mr Rockliff joined the prime minister in Hobart to champion the Yes case.Â  For months, Country Liberal Party NT leaderÂ Lia Finocchiaro maintained a more neutral position, butÂ the territory opposition leader has since announced she willÂ be voting No. ""I personally had made the decision to vote No in the upcoming referendum due to a chronic lack of detail around the representation that Territorians would receiveâ€¦ on any Voice,"" she said. As campaigning in the referendum intensifies, the differing views in the Liberal Party have highlighted what's often referred to as a broad church encompassing conservative and moderate views. High-profile moderate figures in the Yes camp include former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and former foreign minister Julie Bishop. Appearing alongside her Labor counterpart Penny Wong, Ms Bishop argued a No vote would damage Australia's international standing. ""If we can't find it in our hearts to say yes to giving constitutional recognition to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, what are we saying about ourselves?"" she asked. Former Liberal Indigenous affairs minister Ken Wyatt, who turned in his party membership in response to Mr Dutton's Voice opposition, has also urged his colleagues to reconsider their position. On the other hand, former Liberal prime minister and John Howard has lent his weight to the No case, citing concern that the creation of an entity comprised solely of Indigenous people would ""divide"" the nation. ""I don't like anything that divides us according to race and however you slice and dice it, it does do that,"" the conservative figure told Sky News. Monash University politics professor Paul Strangio said he didn't think the differing views were a problem forÂ the Liberal Party. ""In some ways, it might be seen as a healthy thing that the Liberal Party prides itself on being a place where you can have dissenting voices,"" he said. Professor Strangio also said he didn't thinkÂ didn't think the views of state Liberal leaders would hold much weight over how people voted.Â  ""I don't think it'sÂ a great problem for the Liberal Party that you have some state leaders going the opposite way to Peter Dutton and some supporting him,"" he said. ""The main game is very much in that federal sphere.""

ir59,"Supermarkets are telling their mushroom suppliers that sales have decreased by up to 10 per cent in the past few weeks. It comes in the wake of three people dying of suspected death cap mushroom poisoning after a family lunch in the small Victorian town of Leongatha, and the ongoing police investigation into it. The host of the fatal lunch, Erin Patterson, told police she used a mixture of button mushrooms from a major supermarket and dried mushrooms from an Asian store in Melbourne to prepare the beef Wellington that she served to her guests. But the likelihood of a death cap mushroom ending up in the button mushroom supply chain in Australia is ""actually impossible"", said Georgia Beattie, CEO of Bulla Park, Australia's largest organic mushroom farm, and the chair of the Australian Mushroom Growers Association. ""This death cap mushroom is a particular species that is what we call symbiotic and it needs a tree to grow on,""Â Ms Beattie told RN Breakfast. Death capsÂ cause nineÂ out of 10 mushroom poisoning deaths, killing between 10 to 30 per cent of those who consume it. Commercial button mushroom farms, however, are set up to grow the oneÂ typeÂ of mushroomÂ only, which isÂ approved for food consumption. ""Every input is inspected and audited for a start"", Ms Beattie said. ""We've got world-leading standards to produce food in Australia, so consumers can have confidence in that,""Â she said. ""Mushrooms are caught up in the wrong crowd at the moment."" Ms Beattie said the sales decrease is ""not to a point where it's of concern"", but mushroom farmers are monitoring the situation. ""I'm an organic farmer, so our sales have actually increased because the organic certifications are the hardest ones to get, but I think there's a little bit of hesitation,""Â she said. ""We're meeting regularly at the moment and we're really just keeping an eye on it."" The sales decrease is reminiscent of the 2018 strawberry needle contamination saga that saw strawberry prices fall as sales dropped, forcing farmers to dump produce. Sales quickly bounced back thanks to the lower prices and consumers rallying around farmers. Ms Beattie said the strawberry sabotage case was a ""big learning"" for food bodies and major retailers, and the present situation is very different. ""We've got multiple checkpoints at [the distribution centre]Â as well as before [the mushrooms]Â go into the store. If someone did want to do something we're able to capture it very quickly. There's rigour around these certifications and processes now. ""We just recommend people buy Australian-grown and don't go foraging.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-04/mushroom-sales-fall-after-suspected-death-cap-poisoning/102811418
ir60,"Isabella Rounsevell thought she would have moved into her dream home long ago, but lengthy construction delays mean she is still waiting. The 27-year-old signed a 40-week building contract, which is now nearly a year overdue. ""I've been so detrimentally affected by this,Â financially, emotionally, mentally â€”Â I've been in tears on the phone to my dad to try and get some help,"" she said. Ms Rounsevell said the extent of the delay hadÂ ""taken away everything good from the experience of building"". ""We've had four or five different handover dates through the whole process and a plethora of different reasons of why,"" she said. Ms Rounsevell is building with Metricon, one of the biggest housing construction companies in Australia. In July, it was revealed dozens of Metricon customers in NSW who were on fixed-price contractsÂ were being forced to choose between paying higher prices or losing their new homes and deposits, as the builder struggled with soaring labour and material costs. While Metricon said that was not happening in South Australia, it has acknowledged that homebuyers in the state are being impacted by lengthy delays. Karen Bath is another customer waiting to move into a home that isÂ long overdue. While she has been able to rent a room at a friend's place, she said the constructionÂ delays haveÂ had a significant impact on her life. ""I thought I would be sleeping on a mattress on the floor for six to eightÂ weeks when I packed upÂ my [old] house,"" she said. ""[But] I've been sleeping on a mattress on the floor for 10 months. ""It's just so uncertain ...Â it's scary. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."" Metricon'sÂ general manager inÂ South Australia, Neil Bisset, said the company hadÂ been ""wholly reasonable"" while dealing withÂ customers. ""We are relying on some external parties and suppliers and trade labour issues, but we are actually over that now,"" he said. ""I believe we are on the back end of that. ""I can confirm there's been no additional charges for any customers on site with regards to additional labour costs and suppliers."" Ms Bath and MsÂ Rounsevell have also raised concerns regarding the quality of the work and the use of so-called ""reverse build"" methods. A reverse build is when internals of a house are constructed before the externals are complete. ""The damage from rain because of a reverse build was quite distressing,"" Ms Bath said. ""I'm disappointed with the short cuts."" She said insulation was blowing away, leavingÂ ""huge gaps"", and that she had resorted to putting in the material herself. But Mr Bisset said reverse buildÂ methods allow construction to be sped up. ""We look at avenues that improve efficiency on site,"" he said. ""There's certainly no issue with that.""

ir61,"Wimbledon championÂ MarkÃ©ta VondrouÅ¡ovÃ¡ is into the US Open quarterfinals, but was seen in tears shortlyÂ after as she was forced to withdraw from the doubles. VondrouÅ¡ovÃ¡ beat American 21-year-old Peyton Stearns in the fourth round, preventing an all-American quarterfinal of Stearns againstÂ Madison Keys, who upset another compatriot, third seed Jessica Pegula, with a 6-1, 6-3 thumping. VondrouÅ¡ovÃ¡ was made to work much harder for herÂ 6-7 (3/7), 6-3, 6-2 win over Stearns in over two hours on Louis Armstrong Stadium. The ninth seed was due to play doubles later in the day alongside Czech partnerÂ Barbora StrÃ½covÃ¡, but had to pull out of the third-round match with an arm injury. The left-handed VondrouÅ¡ovÃ¡ was seen crying in the players' area with ice on her left elbow, withÂ StrÃ½covÃ¡ wrapping her in a comforting hug. While it is not uncommon for players to withdraw from the doubles draw to conserve energy if they make deep singles runs, VondrouÅ¡ovÃ¡'s emotional exit could have as much to do with her partner as any concerns over her own fitness. StrÃ½covÃ¡, who won Wimbledon doubles titles this year and in 2019, has announced she will retire after this US Open. VondrouÅ¡ovÃ¡ had tape around her elbow at times during the match against Stearns and said she had been feeling pain since before the third round, partly blaming a change towards the heavier balls used by men for this year's women's tournament. ""I mean, I played tough matches. The season is very long, and I feel like the balls are not helping with everything,"" she said. ""Of course, it was a bit sad. I cried a bit when I told Barbora. I had so many injuries that I don't want to play with more. She's a great person, so she told me it's OK. ""I was, like, 'It's your last tournament. I don't want to do it.' She was, like, 'OK, we have to play 100 per cent or we don't play'. So it was OK."" StrÃ½covÃ¡Â was knocked out in the first round of the singles andÂ is now out of the women's doubles, but still has a mixed doubles quarterfinal alongside Mexico'sÂ Santiago GonzÃ¡lez still to come. The womanÂ VondrouÅ¡ovÃ¡ beat to the Wimbledon title this year, Ons Jabeur, missed her chance to reach the last eight, going down 6-2, 6-4 to Chinese 23rd seedÂ Qinwen Zheng. It means four of the top five women's seeds are now out, with only second seed Aryna Sabalenka remaining. She will play Zheng after beatingÂ Daria Kasatkina 6-1, 6-3 in their fourth-round match-up. On the men's side of the singles draw, reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz coasted into the quarters with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Italy's Matteo Arnaldi inside two hours. The world number one has dropped just one set en route to the last eight but will next face a tougher test against sixth seed Jannik Sinner or 2020 US Open finalist Alexander Zverev. No matter what happens in New York, Alcaraz will lose the top ranking to second seed Novak Djokovic. If the pair meet in the final it would be the third straight slam in which they have clashed â€” Alcaraz beat Djokovic in the Wimbledon final and lost to him in the semis of the French Open. In the other quarterfinal in Alcaraz's side of the draw, Russian Andrey Rublev won a tough contest with Englishman Jack Draper 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.

ir62,"GWS small forward Toby Bedford will miss the Giants' elimination final against St Kilda after failing to have his one-match rough conduct ban overturned or downgraded at the AFL tribunal. Week one * All times AEST Bedford was charged for his off-the-ball bump on Carlton defender Zac Fisher in the third quarter of GWS' round-24 win at Docklands. The contact was graded as careless, medium impact and high contact, drawing a one-match ban, after Fisher required a concussion assessment at three-quarter time, which he passed. GWS argued the bump was not high or forceful and should not be considered medium impact. Both of those arguments were rejected by the panel of Jeff Gleeson, Darren Gaspar and Scott Stevens, who agreed with AFL counsel Lisa Hannon's argument the potential to cause a head injury meant the bump should be considered medium impact. Hannon also said the manner in which Bedford approached the ball was unreasonable in the circumstances as he could have elected to shepherd or block without bumping Fisher as strongly as he did. Gleeson cited video and still photo evidence of Fisher's head appearing to come into contact with Bedford's body in a whiplash motion, and the forward holding his jaw after the incident. Bedford, ruled out of his first career AFL final at the MCG on Saturday, did not speak. The Giants relied heavily on testimony from Fisher, who said the bump was not high. ""It was front shoulder against his shoulder,"" Fisher said. ""Through the shoulder, it was a good bump â€” but I definitely could've protected myself a little bit better."" Fisher said he had hadn't wanted to be assessed for concussion as he was ""feeling a-OK to continue"". He had no marks, bruising or swelling left from the contact. The Giants also turned to evidence from a biomechanist, while there was also a back-and-forth between Hannon and GWS counsel Ben Ihle regarding the definition of ""forceful"" contact. Bedford has played 16 games in his first season at the Giants after he was traded from Melbourne, kicking 10 goals and averaging five tackles per game.

ir63,"It was June, the Collingwood Magpies had just won their final Super Netball game, and Nicole Richardson had tears rolling down her face. After five years pouring her heart and soul into the club, three of them as head coach, to beat a top-two-ranked side like the West Coast Fever felt somewhat like a consolation prize in a bittersweet end of an era. A month beforehand, Collingwood, under differentÂ leadership than when its netball team was established in 2016, had decided it would no longer continue. Bottom line,Â its netball program wasn't making money and the administration had grown tired of splitting its investment in women's sport, preferring instead to channel its efforts solely into AFLW. From that lowÂ to the high of winning a Netball World Cup in August as an assistant with the Aussie Diamonds, Richardson was brought back to earth just last week. Almost three months down the line, watching the Pies development team win the Australian Netball Championships (ANC), there she was again, wiping away tears and thinking of what Collingwood netball could have been. ""I was there in my role as an Australian under 21s selector for Netball Australia, but I couldn't help but get caught up in the emotion of it all,"" a proud Richardson told the ABC. ""It brought tears to my eyes because we've had a really tough year at Collingwood and to end the way the girls did, I guess it was a fitting finale to what's been a very emotional three months."" Four of those ANC players â€”Â Olivia Wilkinson, Montana Holmes, Casey Adamson and Zoe Davies â€”Â had been involved with the Super Netball team as training partners the past two seasons, while midcourter Zali Anderson's performances saw her rewarded with Australian U21 selection. Their success was a satisfying justification for what the Pies had been building in recent years. And although their Super Netball team finished with a second wooden spoon in 2023, Richardson and five Collingwood playersÂ reached the podium at the World Cup in Cape Town,Â highlighting the incredible potential of their talented group that never quite clicked into gear at club land. Looking back, the coach points to the closeness of the league and reiterates her side was only one win behind the Giants in sixth place and two behind the Lightning in fifth. Despite being so heavily criticised, the Pies also won a pre-season Team Girls CupÂ (2019), a Super Club Tournament (2019), twoÂ ANC titles (2018, 2023) and reached the finals three times across a seven-year journey in Super Netball â€“ including as recently as last year. That's twice more than current champions the Adelaide Thunderbirds, or even the Queensland Firebirds, both foundation netball clubs with 20 yearsÂ more experience. Were we too hard on Collingwood? Sure, their brash start inÂ the netball scene may have put people offside, as they claimed to beÂ the team to beat in their foundation year. But that was likely football talking.Â Meanwhile, their netballers would face a similar struggle for respect, adequate equipment, and resources toÂ everyone else. In those early years the Pies gave the impression they were the flashy new kids on the block, with incredible facilities and a star-studded side planning to conquer it all. What has since come to light is that their netball department was poorly set up, treated as a second-rate priority, and run by football administrators who thought they could reinvent the wheel. As Linda Pearce reported for Code Sports, the netballers trained with short goalposts and a rock-hard unsprung floor at Collingwood HQ,Â often needing to clean up the mud on the court's surface before they could start a session due to their AFL counterparts walkingÂ it in from the footy field. Reflecting on the club's decision to make their Super Netball team defunct, leaving the coaching group and players searching for new jobs, Richardson said it still felt ""gut-wrenching"". ""I went through the emotions of disappointment and frustration, and there were times there that I was also angry at the club for not backing us in,"" she said. ""I get it;Â sport is business.Â And I've been reminded quite recently that, yes, there are pros of being involved with a massive beast like Collingwood, but at the end of the day they are a football club and their number one aim is football. ""There's been a changeover of the powers that be.Â You had Eddie McGuire and Mark Anderson in the beginning who had a vision moving forward and netball was a part of that, but over time the club decided our sport wasn't good for it financially and so we were on the end of that."" Richardson's recent reminder has been the non-existent support for any of the netball program's achievements beyond its final Super Netball game. Collingwood did at least follow through with its commitment to participate at the ANC, but there has been no promotion of its success at that tournament, nor ofÂ its athletes at the World Cup. ""Once Round 14 against the Fever was finished, that was it for pretty much anything netball related,"" Richardson said. ""There were no socials regarding our five athletes and myself at the World Cup, even after the Diamonds become world champions, andÂ nothing for our ANC team."" The message was clear: ""Collingwood is a football club preparing for finals."" Despite this, and her conflicting feelings on how it all ended, Richardson doesn't like to play the blame game. ""I mean, you can put blame on various different groups, but everyone has a part to play, including the team itself, and to get bums on seats, you need wins. ""We probably didn't have as much success overall as we could have.Â However, I think we still played an exciting brand of netball and were able to do some great things as a relatively young club. ""I understand you have to look after the club as a whole, but I don't think any of the Super Netball teams are making money, and I also believe there's a lot more to having a team outside of the bottom line, in terms of what it can bring. ""Nike got on board at Collingwood due to the female athletes there, of which our netballers were a part of, so there's more that goes into it, but I don't necessarily blame anyone.Â Sport is business."" As she hunts for the next opportunity, Richardson says she is keen on linking up with the incoming SEN-owned team set to take Collingwood's place in the Super Netball league from 2024. English legend Tracey Neville has already been assigned as head coach and the side'sÂ roster seems to be taking shape in an unofficial capacity behind closed doors, as everyone waits on the collective pay agreement (CPA) to be negotiated. Richardson's preference is to stay in Melbourne, but until the CPA is in place, she's in a holding pattern, waiting to see if and where a domestic spot will open up for a specialist coach. ""I'll start training a few of the Diamonds based in Victoria this week for the Constellation Cup and the South Africa series following that, which we're really excited for and looking forward to,"" she said. ""Post that, I love Super Netball, I enjoy working at that level and I still think I have a lot to offer, so I'm a bit like a lot of the playing group at the moment â€”Â stuck in limbo. ""For head coaches, their main aim is to lock in their 10 players once we get the CPA sorted and then they can start officially signing people, including us coaches. ""I'm reading about it in the media just like everyone else, but it looks like there's a lot of movement this yearÂ as some look for opportunity and others look to freshen up and continue to develop their skills after being under the same coach for a period of time."" Speaking from experience, Richardson says SEN will have its work cut out for it trying to compete with the Netball-Victoria-owned Melbourne Vixens, who have such a stranglehold on the market. The state database â€” which has been spoken about at length, and Collingwood was never able to obtain access tooÂ â€” will be key. As will be signing some big-name Victorian stars. There have been reports that Roses shooters Sasha Glasgow and Eleanor Cardwell are headed to Melbourne to play under Neville, and Richardson concedes there is no rule in place to prevent the former Commonwealth Games gold-medal-winning coach from signing an all-England team. ""No, there's nothing there currently to stop that, but Tracey is a very smart coach with proven success, and she understands the landscape and what you need to be successful off the court,"" she said. ""She'd be well aware that they don't want to fall down the same path as Collingwood, so they need to be able to fast-track a support base. And building your entire team around an English playing group could cause some hiccups within Victoria â€¦ I can't wait to see what team she pulls together. ""Obviously the state database is something a lot of clubs rely on to get the message out about Super Netball too, so that's something the new team is going to need to have a look at too and seeing whether something can be done with Netball Victoria or Netball Australia in that area. ""I guess the biggest thing regarding SEN coming on board though compared to CollingwoodÂ is that netball seems to be their number one priority, and that's going to be a key difference.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-04/pies-netball-coach-nicole-richardson-reflects-on-collingwood/102811770

Women's singles fourth round The loss on Sunday night also means ÅšwiÄ…tek's stay at number oneÂ in the WTA rankings will end next week, when current number twoÂ Aryna Sabalenka will rise to the top spot for the first time. ÅšwiÄ…tek's shots were off-target in Arthur Ashe Stadium and she had a difficult time handling the hard hitting from the 20th-seeded Ostapenko, who won the 2017 French Open. ""I knew I have to play my game,"" Ostapenko said after accumulating 31 winners to 18 for ÅšwiÄ…tek. ""I knew I have to be aggressive, because that's what she doesn't really like."" This was not necessarily a huge surprise, based on their previous match-ups: Ostapenko has now improved to 4-0 against ÅšwiÄ…tek over their careers. No other player owns four victories against the woman who has led the WTA rankings since April 2022. ""I was just thinking that I have to play until the very last point, until we shake hands,"" Ostapenko said. ""I didn't really give her many chances."" After getting off to a terrific start to the second set, which she led 4-1, Ostapenko wavered for a bit. That allowed ÅšwiÄ…tek to get a break back and pull within 4-3. But that was only a blip. With ÅšwiÄ…tek having trouble serving â€” perhaps owing to all of the squeaking Ostapenko's shoes did as she moved around during the ball toss while waiting to return â€” the contest quickly tilted in one direction. Ostapenko reeled off seven consecutive games to go up 5-0 in the third set. Ostapenko broke one last time to end it, meaning she won seven of ÅšwiÄ…tek's 13 service games in the match. Ostapenko's first quarterfinal at Flushing Meadows will come against Coco Gauff, the 19-year-old American who eliminated Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 earlier on Sunday. Ostapenko and Gauff have split two previous meetings. The most recent came in the fourth round of the Australian Open in January, and Ostapenko won that one.

ir65,"Australian Rinky Hijikata's career-best major performance has come to an end in the fourth round of the US Open at the hands of American 10th seed Frances Tiafoe. Hijikata was playing in the main draw of a major for just the third time, after reaching the second round at this year's Australian Open and losing his opening match against Rafael Nadal in New York last year. The 22-year-old made it to the round of 16 before 2022 US Open semifinalist Tiafoe ended his run with a 6-4, 6-1, 6-4 win, leaving 13th seed Alex de Minaur as the only Australian still alive in the singles. Hijikata will climb into the top 100 for the first time after his run in New York, meaning he will not have to rely on wildcards to get into major draws, as he has for his three slam appearances so far. But he was given a masterclass in how much more room he has for growth by Tiafoe, who had the crowd on his side throughout the two-hour match at Louis Armstrong Stadium. Tiafoe blasted 15 aces past the Australian, who could not manage any and got his first serve in play less than half the time, allowing him to be broken seven times in the match. Hijikata,Â who won the men's doubles with countryman Jason Kubler at the Australian Open this year, tried to get to the net to change things up and won 17 of his 64 points with his volleying game, but Tiafoe showed off his power with 27 clean winners. Ranked 110th, Hijikata was a relative unknown to most of the main draw and Tiafoe acknowledged he was not sure how to approach him during a 50-minute opening set. ""I've never played him before so I was definitely feeling him out,"" he said after the match. The pair stayed on serve until 4-4 when Tiafoe broke for the first time in the match and held to love to take the opening frame. Hijikata dropped his serve again in the opening game of the second set and powered through the set in under half an hour, before the third was more of a contest over 51 minutes, although it did not look like it would be when Tiafoe held to love in the first game. Tiafoe broke Hijikata for 4-2 and looked set to run through the finish line, but the Australian broke straight back. Tiafoe kept the breaks coming in the next game but again missed out on a chance to serve out the match at 5-3 before Hijikata dropped serve one last time, spraying his final forehand wide to send his American opponent into the quarters of his home slam for the second straight time. The New York crowd is guaranteed to have someone to cheer for in the semifinals of the men's draw yet again, with Tiafoe facing 20-year-old compatriot Ben Shelton in the last eight. Shelton upset another American to make the quarters, beating 14th seed Tommy Paul 6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in their fourth-round clash. Women's sixth seed Coco Gauff was the third local favourite to reach the last eight in the singles when she took down two-time US Open runner-up Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 on centre court. The contest onÂ Arthur Ashe Stadium lasted two hours, with 19-year-old Gauff becoming the first American teenager since Serena Williams to reach successive US quarterfinals. Wozniacki, meanwhile, was playing her first slam since the 2020 Australian Open, as she continues a comeback from a few years in retirement. ""Caroline's back;Â it's like sheÂ never left,"" Gauff said after the match. ""She's been an inspiration growing up. She definitely gets to a lot of balls. Sometimes I felt like I was playing myself."" Gauff will face Jelena Ostapenko after the Latvian player defeated reigning US Open champion and world number one IgaÂ ÅšwiÄ…tek 3-6, 6-3, 6-1. Taylor Fritz made it four Americans in the quarters when he beat Swiss qualifier Dominick Stricker on the men's side of the draw 7-6(7/2), 6-4, 6-4, making him the only man left in the tournament yet to drop a set.

Josh Inglis (42 off 22 balls) and Marcus Stoinis (37*Â off 21) joined in on the fun, but Head was an unstoppable force for most of the innings.

Bavuma eventually got his man with a catch in the deep, but Australia only needed five more runs for victory by that stage. Head had posted scores of just 18 and 6 in the first two matches, and his display on Sunday is an ominous warning for South Africa ahead of the upcoming five-match ODI series, starting on September 7.

ir67,"These houses in Adelaide's south may look abandoned, butÂ in fact the group of 20 homes hasÂ never been lived in. The unfinished housing estate at O'Halloran Hill was left at a standstill following the collapse of Felmeri Homes in July. Further west, another homebuyer is in limboÂ after aÂ separate builder went into liquidation. South Australia has a building indemnity insurance scheme, which is designed to protect consumers in such situations. ""As the housing crisis continues it is not inconceivable that there won't be other builders that find themselves in these difficult situations,"" Premier Peter Malinauskas said last month. ""That's their risk as a business that they take on. ""What we don't want to see is innocent families who have forked out a lot of money who have a mortgage against the property being left behind. ""And that's the role of insurance."" But that insurance does not always protect such familiesÂ â€” so what happens then? In South Australia, building indemnity insurance is underwritten by the state government and arranged by the builders for any domestic building work thatÂ needs to be approved by a council and costs $12,000 or more. Building work cannot start until the insurance has been taken out by the builder, and both the consumer and the council have received a copy of the certificate of insurance. The insurance protects consumers if work is not completed or faulty work is not rectified, or if the builder dies, disappears or is declared bankrupt. At theÂ O'Halloran Hill housing development, an unfinished access road meant homebuyers could not use insurance payouts to finish their builds because tradespeople could not go on site. The ownersÂ â€”Â many of whom were first home buyers â€” were left at a standstill untilÂ the state government announced it would step in to build the community-titled road. The uniqueness of the situation was highlighted by building inspector Mike Pearl, who said roads withinÂ a subdivision were usually built before houses.Â  ""I don't know of a development that's had this happen previously,"" he said. Premier Peter Malinuaskas told ABC Radio Adelaide that the community-titled road ""should have been completed before authority was granted to start building those homes"". A spokesperson for the local council, the City of Marion, said a stipulated condition of its approval to divide the land into 20 allotmentsÂ was to complete a privateÂ driveway. The spokesperson said council had ""adhered to all the necessary processes"" and it was not able to request any type of bond or security under legislation, because the development only consisted of private infrastructure.Â  The mayor, Kris Hanna, said that could be changed with amendments to the Community Titles Act to give councils the power to request bonds for community-titled infrastructure. ""At the moment, if there's a new extension to a suburb, and the developer says, 'We're going to put in 100 homes and have all these roads go into it' â€”Â  and I mean public roads â€”Â council is able to, and usually does, require a bond for those roads to be finished because they're going to be handed over to council to look after ultimately,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""So that's why that system works. ""But under [the] Community Titles Act, all the developer has to do is sayÂ 'Here's the plan, we promise to build all of this stuff for the people who are going to own it.'"" Building indemnity insurance is mandatory and is taken out by the builder. First home buyer Geoff Browne said he signed a contract for a townhouse at Plympton in December 2020 and the property was due to be completed a year later. But more than two years after he signed the contract, only the frames are upÂ and work remains at a standstill afterÂ the builder went into liquidation last month. ""This has turned into a nightmare,"" Mr Browne said. Building indemnity insurance would usually provide a payout in such a situationÂ toÂ coverÂ some of the cost of finishing the work. But Mr Browne said he requested a copy of the building indemnity insurance certificate from the local council, his mortgage broker and the insurance provider, and no-one could find a record of it. ""It does leave us pretty much up shit creek without a boat,"" he said. The City of West Torrens confirmed building indemnity insurance certificates for two out of 10 dwellings at the Plympton site were ""still outstanding"". ""And we are continuing to follow this up with the landowners,"" a council spokesperson said. Building inspector Mike PearlÂ said work should not have begunÂ without the insurance documentation.Â  ""Council shouldn't let them start without insurance in place,"" Mr Pearl said. The development was approved by the local council, the City of West Torrens, in April 2021. A spokesperson forÂ the City of West Torrens said council was advised that building works were commencing at the site a month later, but the insurance documents and builder details were not provided. ""Council advised that details of the indemnity insurance documents were to be provided, however no further correspondence was received, including no additional notifications for further stages of work that had been undertaken at the property,"" the spokesperson said. ""Council became aware in early March 2023 due to a public enquiry that construction had indeed commenced and that there were issues present on site."" The council saidÂ its process was to ""allow builders/developers an opportunity to attend to the requirements of approval prior to any building works commencing onsite"". ""At the point where it is clear that works have progressed, council can then issue enforcement action requiring the cease of any works until conditions of the development approval have been met, including provision of indemnity insurance,"" the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said changes were made in May 2021 to the state government-run PlanSA Portal,Â so that notification of commencement works could not be uploaded without providing mandatory insurance information. ""This also now enables councils to reject the notification if insufficient information isn't provided,"" the spokesperson said. Mr Browne said he wanted to see broader changes in the industry so such a situation could not happen again. He said he had beenÂ struggling to pay bills and rent for somewhere to live while work remains at a standstill on his townhouse â€” and without a clear way forward to pay to finish it. ""We've lost all our savings,"" he said.",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/building-indemnity-insurance-south-australia/102678076
ir68,"Consumers looking for plant-based options to dairy milk have an abundance of choiceÂ available from oat, almond, soy andÂ rice toÂ even macadamia milk. But a product gearedÂ to taste almost exactly like dairy milk that would be shelf-stable for up to three years could soon hit the market. It's milk made from sugar cane, and scientists say the proteins in it are similar to animal proteins. University of Queensland professor of food microbiology Mark Turner explained that the sugar from cane, molasses, and other by-products would be consumed by yeast, which would in turn produce a protein bioidentical to dairy milk. Professor Turner said many startup companies in Australia and overseas were competing in this area. And while the research is continuing, he's confident it's now at the critical stage where it could be successful. Professor Turner said the product would provide an excellent source of protein due to its similarity to animal proteins, including cow milk or eggs. He said while it would depend on the other ingredients included in the milk, the protein produced by the precision fermentation could be incorporated into various foods to boost their protein content. Whether milk made from sugar cane wouldÂ have similar health benefits compared to other plant-based milk, Professor Turner said it wouldÂ depend on the final formulation. Cow protein, or casein, is a high-quality protein that containsÂ all essential amino acids and is highly bioavailable. The product is set to be manufactured through a world-leading Future Foods BioHub in Mackay in collaboration with the Queensland government and Asia-Pacific fermentation company Cauldron. The state government has stumped up $528,000 to get the project off the ground, and Cauldron wasÂ waiting on regulatory approvals to proceed. Cauldron chief executiveÂ Michele Stansfield said canegrowers and scientists were bringing their expertise to the table to develop the new product. ""We're not looking to replace the food chain, we're just looking to complement or supplement it into the future,"" Ms Stansfield said. She said they were creating an alternative value stream for the sugar industry. ""Protein costs a lot more than sugar,"" she said. ""We're hoping it will take some of the fluctuations out of [sugar] pricing and it will ensure the continued use of sugar going forward in a volatile nutritional market. ""We don't want to be stealing from an industry. We want to be adding to an industry."" Mackay Sugar chief executive Jannik Olejas said the project would likely see a reduction in sugar exports, but he was confident the industry would see an economic boost and crop growth. ""Any good businessman would say it's great to have the opportunity either to sell to your next-door neighbour or to export, whatever pays the best,"" Mr Olejas said. He said selling products in Australia rather than exporting would reduce international transport costs for growers. President of Canegrowers Mackay Kevin Borg said the cane industry was in the box seat for this new technology and he saw a strong appetite from consumers. ""In the past, there's been no government support in place, but today, we've got a government that's hell-bent on introducing these projects,"" he said. ""But, if we can afford to just put it over the fence into a plant that's producing protein, I think there's a premium that needs to be paid. ""I'll supply the cane. They can work the science out."" A spokesperson for dairy advocate eastAUSmilk said the organisation had spoken to representatives and all parties agreedÂ further discussion would be beneficial. Ms Stansfield said international milk companies were investing in new technologies to shore up their supply chain.",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2023-09-05/sugar-cane-milk-may-be-plant-based-alternative-to-dairy-startups/102810124
ir69,"The Queensland government has announced a new measure to deal with crime in the state, creating the role of victims' commissioner. Former Queensland Australian of the Year Jon Rouse APM is the man tasked with the job and will serve in an interim capacity until the end of the financial year, when a permanent appointment will be made. The move follows a recommendation from the Women's Safety and Justice Taskforce in 2022 and the findings of the commission of inquiry into the Queensland Police Service's response to domestic and family violence. Interim Commissioner Rouse spent more than 40 years with the Queensland Police Service, before retiring in May this year. Aside from being named Queensland Australian of the year in 2019, he has Queensland Police medal and an Australian police medal.Â  Mr Rouse was a part of Taskforce Argos, where as detective sergeant heÂ implemented Australiaâ€™s first covert operation to proactively target the child sex offenders using the internet to groom and sexually exploit children. ""Predominantly, the last 24 years of my service was focused on the voices of the most vulnerable citizens, not just in Australia, but globally, and that's our children,"" Mr Rouse said. He's on the board of directors ofÂ the Daniel Morcombe Foundation and the International CentreÂ for Missing and Exploited Children. ""MyÂ position on the voice of victims has always been at the forefront of everything I've dedicated my life to so far,"" he said. Basically, to be a voice for the victims of crime. ""Mr Rouse will ensure the voices of victims of crime are heard and that enduring systemic improvements continue to be made to meet their needs,"" Acting Premier Steven Miles said. â€œEngaging with victims of crime, raising awareness and helping to identify how things can be done better will be the key focuses for our new commissioner and given his strong career history, I have no doubt Jon will excel in this role.â€� Attorney-General Yvette D'Ath said victims were in need of further support from the moment of reporting a crime to police through to the longer term. ""And we know that a victim isn't just that person that the crime was committed against. But it also can be those immediately around them who witnessed that crime. So it's understanding the broader concept of who is a victim, and what are we doing to support them?"" Ms D'Ath said. First up, Mr Rouse said he'd be listening to victims of crime. He'll then look to make sure they can find and access all the resources available to help them.Â  ""I understand already that there are a range of services that exist for our victims of crime in Queensland,"" Mr Rouse said. ""So I'm looking forward to looking at exploring that, consulting and speaking to the victims to see what their particular problems and perspectives have been, and trying to find ways forward toÂ to make sure that their voice is heard, and that we can provide better service delivery for them going forward."" Ms D'Ath said Mr Rouse would be involved in setting up a website that would act as a hub for all those services. The state government needs more time to set up the position formally and permanently, as that requires passing laws through parliament.Â  In the meantime, they have appointed Mr Rouse in an interim role.Â  They are hoping to appoint someone permanently by next June. Queensland Opposition Leader David Crisafulli welcomed the move but said it had come late and pointed out the appointment was an interim one. ""This was a recommendation over 15 months ago, it was reinforced in another report late last year,"" he said. ""I used my budget reply speech over three months ago to say that this would be one of the hallmarks of what I would like to achieve. ""I'm going to today say that this is an important step forward.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-02/queensland-victims-commissioner-explainer-jon-rouse/102807306
ir70,"As the ABC's popular and award-winning drama The Newsreader returns for a second season, two of its biggest fans, Leigh Sales and Lisa Millar, are presenting a weekly companion podcast, featuring interviews with the stars, a debrief on each episode and reflections on their own careers. They've been colleagues and close friends for nearly 30Â years. Both started in journalism at a time when TV news looked a lot like the big-hair, big-shoulder pad, big-personality newsroom depicted in the show and have covered some of the biggest news events of the past three decades, as national reporters, foreign correspondents, and presenters of ABC News's signature programs â€“ Sales now with Australian Story after 12 years hosting 7.30 and federal election broadcasts, and Millar as co-host of News Breakfast. The podcast marks the first time they've worked together since they were correspondents in the ABC Washington bureau two decades ago and they told ABC Backstory itÂ seemed like the perfect project to collaborate on. LEIGH: I love companion podcasts to TV shows of which I'm a fan (I especially loved the ones for The Americans and Succession). I also thought it would be great to work again with Lisa and the subject matter of The Newsreader positioned us uniquely to host the related podcast. LISA: Podcast recaps of shows have been around for a while, but the ones lately have been so good that the minute you finish watching the show you want to immediately download the podcast. I'm thinking of Succession companion podcast, which I also loved. It seems like a no-brainer now that the ABC would do something similar, but this is actually the first companion podcast for an ABC drama series. Salesy and I feel like we're made for this â€”Â we both loved the series because it is such carefully crafted television. The acting is incredible, the scripts are so good I wondered what it must have been like sitting in the writers' room with them, and the music and props take us back down memory lane. We both started out as journos not long after The Newsreader is set (1986â€“1988). I started in journalism in 1988 at the Gympie Times and my first job in television was with WIN TV in Townsville in 1992, then I joined the ABC in 1993 as North Queensland reporter based in Townsville. LISA: I saw someone, unnamed, throw a hairbrush across the newsroom once in anger and it nearly pierced the door of the edit suite. I think there was a moment of silence and then everyone kept working. There was a lot more yelling and noise. There are so many parts of the new series that resonate but I can't give you any spoilers. The first series really delivered the stress of a newsroom, of never wanting to screw up, especially as a junior burger. The way cameramen (and they were mostly men back then) would joke and josh around was very familiar to me. LEIGH: It really is quite accurate. My first job was at Channel Nine in Brisbane in 1993, in a very similar role to the Noelene character in The Newsreader â€“ just that junior person who has to do everything from run scripts in to the presenter, to answer the call to viewers, to line up interviews and so on. When I watch Noelene, who's really brilliantly played by Michelle Lim Davidson, it completely puts me back into that nervousness and fear you have when you're the most junior journalist or producer in a newsroom, that you're going to miss something or mess something up or get yelled at. LISA: I was a viewer during those 80s events and remember looking up to those reporters and presenters I was watching each night. And it was still the TV news that you switched on each night to get your news. When I was much younger I used to pretend to interview members of my family and use a very deep voice because at the time it was mainly men who had those prime-time presenting jobs. I related to seeing The Newsreader team leaping onto a big breaking story the minute their (landline) phones rang or pagers went off. I felt like I lived like that for quite a few years. It took me months after coming back from overseas not to answer the phone with an abrupt ""What's happening?"" LEIGH: The episode in the new series that felt awfully familiar to me is when the anchors are hosting the federal election coverage. When the election broadcast theme music started, and the floor manager began counting, ""10,9,8 â€¦"" I actually got a physical feeling of dread and anxiety, like I would when I was the person sitting in the driver's seat! There's an episode in this season where they're covering the Hoddle Street massacre which was before my time, but it did remind me of being anchor of 7.30 when the Lindt CafÃ© Siege happened. I remember walking into the executive producer's office when it started and seeing the live feed coming in from Channel Seven and feeling physically sick, thinking oh my God, that is actually happening right now to those poor people, only a kilometre away. LEIGH: It's not so much a scoop, but the thing I've done in my career that I'm most proud of is my 2018 book, Any Ordinary Day, because still not a week passes that somebody doesn't contact me to tell me that it helped them understand or survive a terrible time. That's incredibly gratifying, to feel that that work has been so useful. The stuff-ups â€“ I would say mostly they've been failures of empathy, especially when I was a junior reporter. I remember in 1994 at Channel Nine doing a story where I didn't take sufficient care to de-identify a young girl in a story about kids who have trouble making friends. Her father rang to complain, and I said to him, ""But you couldn't see her face"" and he said, ""But she has long blonde hair, and you could see her hair. She really does have trouble making friends and now every kid at her school knows you've identified her that way."" It was a real lesson. LISA: I don't like calling them ""scoops""Â but I always felt relieved when people agreed to talk to me when they had just gone through really difficult moments in their lives, if they'd been involved in traumatic experiences. I have had countless stuff-ups. Forgetting key pieces of equipment and only discovering it when you've driven for hours. Or my biggest stuff-up â€“ heading to cover the 2015 massacre in Paris and forgetting my passport and getting all the way to the French border before I realised. LISA: I was always curious about the world, and still am. And I enjoyed the sense of being let in on something big, before anyone else knew about it, and knowing the significance of then being the person to share it with an audience, whether it was a decision at a council meeting in Kilkivan or the death of the Queen. LEIGH: The same thing that appealed to me at the start is definitely what appeals now: people are just so interesting. Being a journalist allows you to stickybeak into people's lives. I've always liked writing too. I like learning about interesting things and writing about them. LEIGH: We met at a dinner with a group of friends in Brisbane â€” we both worked at the ABC but Lisa was in Canberra and I was based on the Gold Coast. I've been trying to shake her ever since, but she just keeps clinging on. Seriously, I have a huge amount of trust for both her professional and personal judgement. We can make each other laugh so hard as well, often over something really innocuous. We were on a train in Japan once and I dropped a little tea cake I was about to eat, and I said, ""Oh no, my madeleine!"" Lisa was in absolute hysterics â€” ""Oh my god Salesy, you wanker, not, 'Oh no, I've dropped my cake', you've dropped your MADELEINE."" Now I only have to say I dropped my madeleine and we both dissolve into helpless laughter. Millar doesn't care about accuracy as much as I do â€“ contrary to her cavalier attitude, it was not a cupcake, it was not a muffin, it was not a macaron: it was most definitely a madeleine. LISA: Salesy is a stickler for details and facts and I admire that. We are different in many ways but similar in ways that I think help when we're working together â€”Â although this will be the first time we will be doing that since I left the Washington bureau in 2005. We both love To Do lists and being organised. I have been known to do something and then add it to my To Do list retrospectively so I can cross it off. I love the sense of achievement.

ir71,"Many of us are now dressed head to toe in plastic. A textile derived from the same non-renewable source as takeaway containers, has grown to make up more than half of the clothes bought in Australia. Polyester is durable, cheap, and dries quickly. It's also easy to print patterns on. It'sÂ commonly used by itself or as a blend with other textiles. It's used for gym clothes and sports uniforms, party dresses, work attire, and many cheap fast fashion items. And every purchase is taking an environmental toll. One Australian study by RMIT found a single 100 per cent polyester T-shirt has a carbon footprint â€” from creation through to when you dump it in the bin â€” equivalent to 20.56 kilograms of CO2 emissions (CO2e). That'sÂ equivalent to driving 140 kilometres. Buy just six tops, and that gets you all the way from Melbourne to Sydney. So, what's involved in getting a T-shirt from a fossil fuel, to the one you might be wearing right now? Here's itsÂ journey along the supply chain. Our polyester top starts off as crude oil. It's derived from petroleum: a non-renewable fossil fuel. Just getting this out of the ground or ocean has well-known impacts on the planet, including air and water pollution. This petroleum then goes through a process called polymerisation to turn it into semi-crystalline plastic pellets called polyethylene terephthalate (PET). That's the same stuff your plastic bottle is made from. To make the PET for just one polyester T-shirt, you need 7.6 kilowatt hoursÂ of energy and that will emit 5.95kg of CO2e, according to a 2018 study by Australian researchers at RMIT. This makes PET production one of the most energy intense stages of our T-shirt's life cycle. To make polyester, PET pellets are then fed through a machine with other agents, including spin finish oil, sodium hydrosulphite and acetic acid. Some researchers describe this industrial process as like shoving melted plastic through a shower head. At the end, you get a type of spun yarn. This spinning process uses a lot of energy. Our T-shirt requires 5.32kWh of energy to be spun into something resembling your final fashion item. That's not counting other environmental side effects, such as water and chemical usage during the fabric's dyeing process. The dyes used in textile production can pollute waterways with toxins and carcinogens, including chromium. It may be no surprise then that the textile industry is recognised as one of the world's biggest polluters. Now our fossil fuel is starting to resemble something a little closer to a garment. It is a textile that can be cut up and sewed. Few garments are made in Australia anymore. A garment's country of origin makes a big difference to its final carbon footprint, according to data given to ABC News by Carbonfact, a tech company that helps brands track their carbon footprint. A polyester T-shirt made in Vietnam emits 25 per cent less CO2e than a top made in India, CarbonfactÂ data shows. That's because India is far more reliant on coal for its energy. China and Bangladesh fall in the middle. ""The carbon intensity of the electric mix of the country where those processes happen impact the final number,"" Carbonfact's co-founder Martin Daniel says. You also get leftover fabric when you cut patterns. This discarded textile waste can then end up in landfill or incinerated. There is also a human toll. It's now been a decade since one of the worst garment factory disasters in history killed 1,100 people in Bangladesh. Human rights groups like Oxfam warn that many Australian brands still aren't doing enough to protect workers in their supply chains. Now we have something that is ready to sell. Distribution requires plastic slips, boxes, wrapping, garment tags and lots of transport. Clicking express post? Next time you pay for this extra service to get an item by the weekend, you may want to consider its far higher environmental impact. Your polyester T-shirt will be responsible for 120 times more in CO2e emissions if it is flown from China to Australia, rather than brought here by sea freight, Carbonfact data shows. Many brands overall have a long way to go with disclosing their environmental impacts. ABC News approached a range of major brands that sell polyester T-shirts in Australia, including Uniqlo, Kmart, Asos, Shein, and Rebel Sport. None replied with breakdowns of the carbon or environmental footprint of their items. So you've got your new polyester top! We hope you treasure itÂ after all it has gone through to get to you. You might be surprised that this next stage of its life cycle with you will be one of its most environmentally intensive. That's because of the water and energy you'll use to care for it. That same 2018 study by Australian researchers at RMIT modelled this stage of a polyester T-shirt's life cycle.Â  They estimated 50 washings during its one-year life span with regular use of tumble dryers. This would contribute to nearly a third of its carbon footprint overall, they found, or 6.25kg of CO2e emissions. The researchers also found that a T-shirt washed 50 times in its lifetime would require 3.11kWh of energy and 135 litres of water. The production of the required detergent alone would lead to 2.5kg of CO2e. As well as using lots of energy, every time you wash that polyester top, it will shed tiny particles of plastic. This problem, known as microplastics, is now a major threat that is choking our animals and ecosystems. A third of the microplastics being released into our oceans and waterways are from synthetic textile shedding, one study from 2017 found. Washing your polyester top less may help. Polyester is notoriously non-breathable, however, so you may end up a bit smellier. If you're in a sunny and warm place, then line-drying should be your default, says Queensland University of Technology fashion and design lecturer Dr Zoe Mellick. Microplastics protector bags are also an option to prevent them leaching out into the environment. If this article has unsettled you, there are things you can do about it. Firstly, before you click purchase or take an item to the register, sustainability experts urge you to contemplate: do you really need this? Could you get this item second-hand instead? Australians buy on average 56 new garmentsÂ a year or 14.8kg of textiles. That makes us one of the biggest consumers of fashion in the world â€”Â and we're throwing away a lot of it. In Australia, 6,000kg of clothing and textiles are dumped in landfill every 10 minutes. ""Synthetic fibres [like polyester] take a lot longer to decompose,"" Dr Mellick says. ""Some studies have said between 20 to 200 years to decompose. ""We've got to be looking for things that are durable en masse for as long as possible."" It might also be tempting to buy garments that claim they're better for the planet, such as recycled polyester or synthetic replacements. Be warned: fashion is rife with greenwashing, says the consumer watchdog ACCC. You might also think you're doing the right thing if you put your polyester T-shirt in the recyclingÂ bin. While it might be made from PET, polyester is often blended with other textiles, which makes it difficult to recycle. ""Consumers should be more aware of their use,"" the lead author on the RMIT 2018 study, Shadia Moazzem, told ABC News. ""Consumers just buy, wear it a few months and dispose of it."" Lastly, treasure what you have. Learn to mend garments before chucking them, and use ones beyond repair as rags. After all, one simple polyester T-shirt has gone through a lot just to get to you.",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-08-29/polyester-t-shirt-lifecycle-carbon-emissions-environment/102726502
ir72,"Sometimes, being a renter in Australia just plain sucks. You might be forced to move over and over again, unable to secure a long-term lease. You might be waiting months for repairs, only to get the ""landlord special"". Maybe, like many in Australia, you've had your rent hiked by an eye-watering amount. Perhaps you've needed to make a drastic change, like 44-year-old Stephen Papadopolous, a renter of 20 years, who recently moved back in with his parents after his landlord sold his apartment of five years in Sydney's Dulwich Hill. ""I absolutely love the area, I have so many friends close by,"" he says. ""I tried looking close by in the Inner West for apartments and went to a few open inspections, and the queues and the crowd that turned up was just crazy. ""For five years, I was renting a two-bedroom apartment on my own for $400 a week with no rent increase, and then to have to go find one-bedroom apartments for over $600 was a bit of a shock."" He's now living in his parents' Campbelltown home, on the outskirts of metropolitan Sydney, and is in no rush to rejoin rental inspection queues. ""I would never rent again,"" he says. ""My plan is to save some money while I don't have to pay anything living with my mum and dad and buy a place because it's just so unpredictable."" Across the housing sector, from renters to real estate agents and landlords, there's broad agreement that Australia's rental system needs an overhaul â€” and fast. The problem is, few agree on what that change should look like. CoreLogic's head of residential research Eliza Owen says in this ""landlord's market"", requests for homelessness services have been increasing every year since 2012. ""The rental system has to change,"" she says. Leo Patterson Ross from the Tenants'Â Union of New South Wales describes the market as ""broken"". ""It does not achieve what should be its primary purpose of delivering good homes to people in the areas that they need it and with the size and quality that they're looking for."" And while he doesn't agree with Patterson Ross on the solutions, Real Estate Institute of Australia President Hayden Groves agrees we have a problem: ""There is no doubt right now we are in a rental crisis."" ""We don't have enough rental properties to go around, and this shortage of supply in the rental pool is causing rents to rise very rapidly."" So, how did things get so bad â€” and what, if anything, can be done to fix it? For more than 15 years, CoreLogic's estimates of median rent values in Australia had been trundling along at a relatively slow pace, growing by, on average, 2 per cent a year in the 2010s. At the start of the pandemic, advertised rents even fell a little. But any fall has been dwarfed by a rapid rise since late 2020. There's a clear hinge point in September 2020, where rents started to shoot up. ""Prices didn't fall anywhere near as much as you might have expected given the circumstances, and their return has been incredibly rapid,"" Patterson Ross says. ""But those price shocks didn't apply everywhere equally â€¦ the fringes of Sydney never saw a drop in prices but have seen the massive increases in rents."" In fact, in the past two and a half years median rent values have risen by as much as they did in the entire 13 and a half before that. That's had a big impact on rental affordability, measured by looking at how much of a typical income you would need to spend to pay your rent. One common way of assessing rental affordability is through what is often dubbed the 30 per cent rule: a home is affordable if you're spending less than 30 per cent of your income on rent. It's not a perfect rule and makes more sense for low-income earners than the wealthy, but according to CoreLogic's estimates, most renters are now sitting above that threshold. ""Lower income households are more likely to be in the private rental market [and] they're seeing much higher levels of incomes required to service rents,"" Owen says. It's a relatively rapid change, reversing most of a decade's worth of improvement. Rental properties are less affordable in regional areas than in the capital cities, and regional areas have seen some of the biggest price spikes. Since March 2020 some parts of Australia, particularly in Western Australia, have seen rent values rise as much as 50 per cent. In parts of Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide, rent is up by as much as 30 per cent. Demand for homes will inexorably creep up as long as our population is growing, but two pandemic-related shocks have piled on significant extra pressure. As lockdowns became a fact of life, and anyone who could work from home was encouraged to, the number of people living in each house fell from about 2.55 to an average of less than 2.5. That fall in household size might seem minuscule, but it's a national average and the Reserve Bank says it meant roughly 120,000 new households were formed. That rejigging and splitting up of homes created new demand equivalent to about 70 per cent of the homes that were completed in Australia in 2022, according to dwelling completion data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Real estate agent Angelo Lofitis says he's seen a lot of people who have been looking for new ways of living.Â ""They want either more space to work at home, or they want to live separately, where they used to live together,"" he says. ""So there's a definite change in styles of accommodation that were required post-COVID."" Owen says people living in share houses in particular faced additional stress. ""People were making these decisions around who they really wanted to live with,"" she says. Then a surge of new residents entering Australia once border closures were lifted in 2022 created even more demand. ""We saw a big catch-up in overseas migration,"" Owen says. ""Other factors have boosted net overseas migration to quite extraordinary levels â€¦ you've got this unusually large surge in overseas arrivals to Australia which is further compounding rental demand."" Loads more demand has come at a time when there are fewer houses coming on to the market than we've seen in a very long time. CoreLogic observed half as many new rental listings in April this year than it had seen three years earlier. And the national vacancy rate â€” in short, the share of rental properties that are unoccupied at any given time â€” has fallen to about 1.3 per cent from an average of 2.9 per cent last decade, according to CoreLogic. ""The current vacancy rates in Sydney are lower than I've ever seen in 30 years,"" Lofitis says. It means desperate rental hunters are repeatedly met with crowds of other hopefuls at house inspections. â€œWe had 40 groups inspecting, obviously that can only go to one group, and itâ€™s hard to see 39 groups not get approved,""Â Lofitis says. ""I'm hearing from tenants that they're finding it hard to get any properties within their budget that they're interested in renting."" ""If they're finding properties that are suitable for them, it's out of their budget."" It's quite a turnaround from the apartment boom years of the mid-2010s when we saw record investment in new buildingsÂ that helped put a cap on rental growth. ""Throughout the 2010s, Australia had structurally declining interest rates and quite favourable terms for investors that had been introduced over the decades,"" Owen says. ""That really contributed to a surge in new apartment development."" But where there's a boom, there's often a bust lurking around the corner â€” that came toward the end of the decade. ""We started to see investors dropping out of the market quite heavily and that was in response to changes in lending conditions because the mortgage market was being exposed to more risk,"" Owen says. Then came the pandemic. ""You've had an increase in freight costs, material costs, labour shortages â€¦ that's reduced the delivery of new rental supply as well."" And the number of new dwellings in the pipeline, approved but not yet completed, has been falling for years. ""In the short term I think we're going to face another challenge with the new supply of housing and that's because dwelling approvals have been trending lower as interest rates have risen,"" Owen says. ""There's a lot in the construction pipeline right now but when that's complete, I think you're facing a bit of a vacuum of new projects for 2024."" In the short term, what's a renter to do? ""There's not much happening in the supply response, so it's got to be tenants taking things into their own hands,"" she says. ""That does look like share houses reforming â€¦ for some it might also be trying to hold on to their current lease for longer rather than battle it out looking for a new rental."" It would be easy to just blame the pandemic for our housing woes and call it a day. Most of those pandemic factors will eventually recede back to historically typical levels, causing rents to fall back into line. Indeed, that's already starting to happen. ""We've already seen annual growth in rents start to drop off from a peak of about 10.2 per cent at the end of last year to 9.4 per cent in the 12 months to July,"" Owen says. ""Rental pressures are probably going to start to ease up a bit in 2024. ""I really hope that doesn't mean that we let go of this conversation, and rights for tenants and the provision of social and affordable housing, because if we do have a shock in the future, we don't want to be going through something like this again."" Analysts, renters and real estate agents agree that a change in the makeup of the rental market has meant we've lost some of the cushioning we once had for these kinds of shocks. The majority of rental properties are owned by landlords with just one investment property. The other big owners of rental properties are governments, but those homes are a shrinking slice of the market. In the 1980s, as many as one in 10 homes being approved to be built were owned by governments as public housing. That's fallen to just two per cent of approvals each year. There was a brief spike in new public approvals under the Rudd government, largely due to a stimulus package in the wake of the global financial crisis. There's broad agreement that's been a mistake. Hayden Groves, who represents real estate professionals, says Australia needs a more diverse market. ""We need to stop being so reliant on just mum and dad investors to supply the rental stock,"" he says. Patterson Ross says Australia's failure to grow the public and community sector ""has been a really bad mistake on behalf of parties of both stripes for many, many decades"". ""We know looking around the world that comparable economies, comparable societies to ours have much higher rates of social housing."" The Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute estimates that 29.1 per cent of Netherlands properties are social housing, nearly a quarter of homes are publicly owned in Austria, 21 per cent in Denmark, and 17 per cent in England. In Australia, it estimates the number is 3.8 per cent. Some analysts say that's one of the big reasons we've seen such a big pandemic-related shock now. The argument is that social housing has historically been a safety net for low-income people, helping reduce the impact of housing market fluctuations on those most vulnerable to them â€” but that net now has some gaping holes. ""We've seen an increase in social housing waitlists, which are now well over 100,000Â nationally, so clearly we just need that housing to be directly supplied,"" Owen says. ""We can't be subject to the kind of volatility and increase in homelessness that we've seen over the past few years. ""We need to change the way we think about providing rental housing so that we don't get into this kind of situation again."" Patterson Ross says Australia should aim to reach a point where public housing makes up at least 10 per cent of all housing stock. ""That's the level at which we're starting to meet the needs of the people who aren't currently being met â€¦ and providing a level of competition across the market."" The rental market is a big and complicated beast, and no single measure to boost supply is going to be a permanent fix to worsening affordability. Indeed, tenants' advocates would argue that the market we have just isn't capable of delivering what renters need: stable, adequate, affordable housing. ""We've seen ebbs and flows of a crisis over many decades, but really we have gotten used to a poorly run renting system,"" Patterson Ross says. ""This has been a long time coming."" Recently, the Greens have seized on the growing discontent and have launched a push for increased renters' rights, including a freeze on rental increases. The federal government has so far resisted calls to freeze rents, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says a ""better deal for renters"" is on the way after state and territory leaders agreed to a new target of 1.2 million new homes to be built. The national cabinet also pledged to move to nationally consistent rules requiring reasonable grounds for eviction, limits on rent increases to once per year, and a phasing in of minimal rental standards. While it falls short of what the Greens were hoping for, the past year has demonstrated the increased electoral power of renters â€” roughly a third of all Australians rent, according to the ABS â€” and their growing involvement in the conversation. The tone of the conversation has Patterson Ross more optimistic than he has been in the past, but he says it can't just be about supply and demand. Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting something different to happen. Are we talking about madness, or the Australian property market? The way that Australia's market has evolved over decades has left us with a market where most rental properties are owned by small investors. ""We have had generations of family investors supplying affordable rental accommodation for Australians for an awfully long time now,"" Hayden Groves says. ""To unravel that and unpick that in a comprehensive way is going to take an equal amount of time, perhaps generations, to do so effectively."" The trouble is that all the players in the sector have different financial stakes in the market, and therefore different views on precisely what it is that must change. Take proposals for rent caps, for example.Â While many renters believe they are an essential step to halt a spiralling crisis,Â investors who bought into a rental market operating under one set of rules may feel like changes that limit their returns are unfair. ""We have to stop biting the hand that feeds us, and the hand that's feeding us right now is the mum and dad investors,"" Groves says. Tenant advocates say that's precisely the problem. ""Houses are being treated as an asset,"" Patterson Ross says. ""The right to make an income off that property needs to be balanced against people's need for a home. That's where we've gone wrong.""

ir73,"The sight of grassy slopes at Australia's ski resorts this winter has been the stuff of nightmares for skiers, snowboarders and mountain lovers. It is also a stark reminder of the impacts that human-induced climate change is already having and a warning of what is to come, according to a studyÂ modelling the impacts of a warmer world on ski resorts in Europe. Europe is home toÂ about 50 per cent of the world's ski resorts, which depend on reliable and predictable snow cover. The research,Â published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that 53 per cent of European ski resorts were projected to be at very high risk of a lack of snow supply with less thanÂ 2 degrees Celsius of global warming above pre-industrial levels. It found that 98 per cent of resorts would be at very high riskÂ with less than 4C of warming.Â  Global temperatures sit atÂ 1.2C above pre-industrial levels and anÂ analysis from Carbon Brief shows the world will reach 2C of warming between 2038 and 2072 if emissions remain close to current levels. The study's lead author, Samuel Morin from France's National Centre for Meteorological Research, said the modelling accounted for geography, elevation and regional differences. ""We found that if we don't account for snowmaking, the conditions will get worse â€¦ because there is a wide snow decline because of the warming,"" he said.Â  ""When it's warmer, snow tends to be replaced by rain in precipitation and the snow melts quicker."" Dr Morin saidÂ ""very high risk"" was a metric based on how often bad seasons would occur, rather thanÂ on average snow conditions. ""What matters is how often they experience challenging conditions like snow-scarce, snow-poor winters, and how frequently that happens,"" he said.Â  ""It's a bit like a heatwave â€” it doesn't matter much to say that the temperature has increased by one or two degrees locally, on average. ""The question is how frequently you get those extreme, high events. ""What we call 'very high risk' is when we reach that shift from a once-in-five years event into once-in-two years events â€” so basically going from 20 per cent to 50 per cent of the winters that have those challenging conditions."" One way for ski resorts to shore up conditions is to make artificial snow, but doing so increases water and energy use. TheÂ researchers used models to quantify the potential impacts of artificial snowmaking and foundÂ the practice could reduce the number of resorts at very high risk to 27 per cent under the 2C mark and 71 per cent of thoseÂ under 4C.Â  But it would come at a cost. ""On average it's about 20 per cent higher water demand for 2C global warming and like 30-40 per cent water demand increase for 4C global warming,"" Dr MorinÂ said. ""And that goes together with energy and carbon emissions for snowmaking."" He said the ski industry and governments had some big questions to contemplate. ""Something we address in that particular paper as well is what is the impact of ski resorts and ski tourism on climate change and it goes way beyond the emissions due to snowmaking,"" Dr Morin said. ""It's mostly transportation, it's mostly housing, and so that's the key issue that we point to in the paper as well â€” how sustainable that is, and how can ski resort managers, but also the authorities of those mountain areas â€¦ combine adapting to climate changeÂ while at the same time reducing emissions."" In Australia, climate change has resulted in a long-term decline in the maximum depth and duration of the snow season since the late 1950s, according to theÂ Bureau of Meteorology's 2022 State of the Climate report. It said ""the largest declines"" came ""during spring and at lower altitudes"". ""Downward trends in the temporal and spatial extent of snow cover have also been observed,"" the report said. ""The number of snowfall days has also decreased. Years with persistent heavy snow cover have become rare."" Omar Elkadi from climate advocacy group Protect Our Winters said focusing only on snow depth couldÂ mask some of the bigger problems. ""If you look at the snowfall ratesÂ say 50 years ago, we used to get a lot more smaller top-ups, which built the base over time,"" he said. ""But recently, what's happened â€¦ we call them Snowmageddon â€¦ we get these massive fronts come through, and they drop a huge amount of snow, often, because they're so strong,"" he said. ""With climate change, what we're starting to see is we aren't getting those smaller top-ups in between, so you have these booms and busts. ""There will be some great days to come, of course, but as they get warmer, the margins of error are just becoming finer and finer. ""The booms will be slightly less and the busts will be slightly more prevalent."" Mr Elkadi said 2023 looked set to be the worst year in terms of snow depth since 2006, when Australia recorded its lowest depth on record. He said Australian resorts had done a good job of managing the snow this year, but the lower altitude resorts were struggling. ""Ask a snow-maker if you're out there about this year, because they've just had so few nights to pump out snow, because the wet bulb temperatures were too high, the humidity was too high â€” it was simply too warm,"" Mr Elkadi said. ""That's the scary thing for those low resorts, because they can't actually rely on the snow-making sometimes â€” it's a pretty bleak outlook for some of those resorts."" As in Europe, Mr Elkadi said how Australian resorts managed water and energy use was a big question. ""Snow-making reduces the variability that we're going to get from climate change for the ski resorts so they can effectively operate in the right way and provide a product for their customers,"" he said. ""But of course, it's so energy intensive and so water intensive and that diverts water away from ecosystems as well if not managed correctly.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-08-29/ski-resorts-under-threat-from-climate-change/102778814
ir74,"There haveÂ been more than 140 lunar missions since the 1950s, including historic landings, uncontrolled crashes and vast orbits around this celestial body. But after the end of the political ""space race""Â between the United States and the USSR (now Russia), expeditions to this satellite â€” less than a third of the Earth's width â€” dwindled. It's only recently that interest has surged again, with India on course to land on the lunarÂ south pole as soon as tomorrowÂ andÂ Russia declaring the race has begun for the Moon'sÂ resourcesÂ after itsÂ failed landing attempt on Sunday. Like the US and China, they'veÂ been spurred on by NASA's discoveryÂ of water molecules on the Moon which could help foster a human colony. So here's what we know about past Moon landings, and what future missions will focus on.Â  Only four countries have successfully landed on the Moon using a lander or ""impactor"": the United States, Russia (formerly USSR), China and India. Put simply, a lander is a spacecraft that's designed to landÂ on the surface of a celestial body, while an impactor isÂ destroyed upon landing. In total, there's been 27 successful landings using theseÂ methods, including six missions thatÂ carriedÂ humans.Â  These figures exclude flybyÂ and orbit missions, which involve flying close to the moon or circling it for remote observations. The European Space Agency deliberatelyÂ crashed its SMART-1 orbiterÂ into the Moon after it had completed its mission in September 2006. Japan, Luxembourg, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates have also made contactÂ with theÂ surface by crashing their spacecrafts, though unintentionally. In September 1959, the USSR's unmannedÂ Luna 2 spacecraftÂ was the first man-made object to successfully land onÂ the Moon. Ten years later, in July 1969, America'sÂ Apollo 11Â was the first spacecraftÂ to carry humans to theÂ surface. The ""space race""Â between the two Cold War rivals resulted in nearly all of their Moon landings takingÂ place in the 60s and 70s. Humanity then took a 37-year break from Moon landings, before China achieved its firstÂ touchdown in 2013. The country went on to become the first to land on the ""far""Â side of the MoonÂ in 2019, which is the side facing away from Earth. Nowadays, the most mysterious parts of the Moon are actually at itsÂ poles, where the sun always hovers near the horizon. Hundreds of craters at the north and south poles neverÂ receive direct sunlight and are thought to contain water ice that could support a future Moon settlement. Twelve people have touched downÂ and they wereÂ all American. Neil Armstrong was the first person to take that ""giant leap for mankind"" in 1969, and Eugene CernanÂ was the last one to step footÂ in 1972. Only four of theÂ Moon-walkers are still alive today: All crewed moon landings took place as part of America'sÂ Apollo program and across six space missions (Apollo 11 to 12, 14 to 17).Â  Humans have not been back since, and the Moon remains the only celestial bodyÂ besides Earth that we've ever visited in person. The cost of sending someone to the Moon is, ironically, astronomical.Â  Whilst the US government was willing to put US$25.8 billion into the Apollo missions when it was helpful to the space race, the motivation was gone once the countryÂ had won. In an interview with CNN in 2019, former NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said it wouldÂ cost up toÂ US$30 billion to carry out another crewed mission. But with newÂ interest in the Moon's water harbouring regions, politiciansÂ may be persuaded to spend big on crewedÂ expeditions once more. Journeys to the Moon in the 21st century will focus more on the creation of lunar bases or satellites. The Indian Space Research Organisation says itsÂ Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft is on course to land on the Moon by tomorrow. If successful, it would be the first country to touchdown on the lunar south pole.Â  It's believed the region's water ice could become a source of drinking water for moon exploration and could help cool equipment. It could also be broken down to produce hydrogen for fuel and oxygen to breathe, supporting missions to Mars or lunar mining. Despite the failure of its first lunar mission in 47 years, Russia has said it must remain a player in the race to explore and develop the Moon's resources. The country hinted at the possibility of future joint missions with China and even a lunar base. Meanwhile, NASA has saidÂ it plans to send four astronauts to the Moon's orbitÂ in late 2024 as part of a mission called Artemis II. The crew willÂ include the first-ever woman and person of colour. The 10-day test flight is designed to confirm all of the spacecraft's systems operate, pavingÂ the way for humans to touch down on theÂ following mission, Artemis III. Bridenstine previously saidÂ the aim is to establish a long-term presenceÂ at the Moon for future spaceÂ exploration: ""This time when we go to the Moon we're going to stay. That's what we're looking to do.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-08-22/fifty-years-since-walking-on-moon-whats-prompting-the-lunar-race/102758382
ir75,"Alysha always thought using drugs while pregnant would be the lowest she could go. ""It's the one thing I said I would never, ever, ever, ever do, and I did it,"" she says. ""I never wanted to be a pregnant drug user."" The 24-year-old was using when she got pregnant earlier this year. ""I haven't used ice the whole pregnancy, but I kept relapsing and I was using cannabis."" She says she was doing whatever she could to get through the day. ""There's a lot of stuff that's happened in the last three years that I've tried to forget about, so I was just using. ""I was just surviving. ""But I thought, how am I gonna live with myself when I have this baby and know that I used when I'm pregnant?"" There are many women in Alysha's position. Thousands of babies who've been exposed to their mother's drug use are born in Australia every year. Frontline clinicians say there has been a clear shift to methamphetamines like ice in the past decade. Help can be difficult to find. ""There's been points in my life where I've been in hospitals and I've been, like, begging, crying for help and they've just looked at me like, you're a worthless junkie,"" Alysha says. ""There is so much shame and guilt around it that just keeps people from reaching out and saying, 'Hey, I'm pregnant and I need help.'"" Alysha was lucky to get a place at Bridgehaven in Melbourne, a women-only residential rehab program run by the Salvation Army. ""I had to push for it really hard â€¦ on the phone every day crying and saying, like, 'please, please hurry, hurry, hurry'."" It can take months to get into detox and residential rehab centres â€” very few places in Australia allow women to keep their babies with them during treatment. Alysha had to travel four hours from regional Victoria and undergo seven days of detox before she could start the program. She knew she urgently needed to break her addiction before her baby girl's birth. Terrianne has used drugs all the way through pregnancies before. ""I couldn't stop. I was still in that bad addiction."" One baby was born withdrawing from ice. ""There was jittering, the body would always like shake, very hard to settle."" This can happen when a baby is exposed to ice late in a pregnancy. As newborns, they're often lethargic and struggle to wake up, or alternatively, they can be irritable and agitated. This time was different. Terrianne gave birth to Lockie a few months ago. ""For the first month to the third month of Lockie's life of growing inside me. I did [use], yeah. ""I feel happy now that it wasn't the whole way through like the other children."" DuringÂ the pregnancy, Terrianne was able to get into Bridgehaven. Unlike heroin, there's no replacement therapy medication for methamphetamines. The only treatment is detox and counselling. Four Corners follows women struggling with addiction as they fight to get help for themselves and their unborn babies. Watch now onÂ ABC iview. ""I had a 19-year addiction of weed and ice. I tried quitting a few times, been to detox three times, but never ever considered rehab 'cause I thought I was too good â€¦ Clearly, I wasn't,"" she says. ""It was really hard. I was like an everyday user â€¦ so I had to wean myself off it and then just, yeah. Pretty much quit."" Lockie is now living with her as she completes rehab. Their bedroom is down the hall from Alysha. ""He's very calm, very content â€¦ I'm honestly blessed,"" Terrianne says. ""Lockie's my eighth â€¦ my lucky eighth."" It's the first time in nearly two decades the 32-year-old has completely stopped using drugs. ""I used to blame myself for a lot of things but, in my eyes, it's not really my fault. Something happened to me when I was a 13-year-old child, which started my addiction. ""That's all I really knew. ""The more you take, the longer you take it, the addiction just stays there. ""Addiction is a very vicious cycle."" Lockie has regular check-ups with a neonatologist who is carefully monitoring his development. Research shows babies prenatally exposed to methamphetamines are at higher risk of being born preterm and tend to be smaller at birth. In the early years, they can lag behind children who aren't exposed. But experts say with early intervention, many of these effects can be overcome. So far, Lockie is hitting all his milestones. ""I'm feeling positive, feeling grateful that I've come this far and able to keep Lockie with me and meet all his needs,"" Terrianne says. ""Cause if I didn't stop when I did, I wouldn't have him right now."" Bryce was exposed to drugs before he was born. He's still living with the consequences. Now 19, he was removed from his parents and put into foster care at 18 months old. ""I guess in a way they couldn't control it because of addiction,"" he says. ""But it does frustrate me 'cause when I experience issues related to being prenatally exposed, the frustration goes to them. ""The only reason that I am the way I am is because of them. There's no other place to shift blame. It's allÂ their doing. ""Their actions have had consequences that I have to bear. They don't."" As a toddler, Bryce was very small for his age. His foster carer, Stacy, took him to a paediatrician who found his growth hormone was low. He's also had issues with his eyesight. Some research shows behavioural issues can intensify as prenatally exposed children get older, especially if there are other environmental factors like family violence and poverty. ""Learning in school was very difficult,"" Bryce says. ""Even at my place of work and my career, I have to be trained to do stuff and just in taking information how I understand it, how it needs to be given to me in order for me to understand things. It's different to a lot of people. Takes me a little bit longer. ""I know I'm smart and I know I can do it. It's just the way I learn is different."" Bryce recently dropped out of university because he was having difficulties focusing. But he's since found a job that he loves. He credits his foster mum and a loving family home for helping him stay on track. ""I could have ended up incarcerated, on drugs, could have ended up in every bad path that there possibly is,"" Bryce says. ""I've always been proud of myself 'cause with all the issues that I face, if I can overcome and adapt to them, then that's an achievement for me."" Stacy now trains other foster carers to help them understand what their kids may be going through. Unlike foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, there's no diagnosis or specific funding for prenatal drug exposure. ""It is easier to turn a blind eye and it's easy to pretend that it doesn't exist. But these children, their lives matter,"" she says. ""They didn't choose to be born into the contexts that they have."" Stigma and fear of what will happen to them and their babies often stop women like Alysha and Terrianne from getting help. Those women that do seek help, don't always find services. New data compiled by the Victorian Alcohol and Drug Association has found that, on any given day, there are more than 800 people waiting to get into residential detox or rehab in Victoria alone. At the Women's Alcohol and Drug Service in Melbourne, Terrianne's midwife Elvira cares for newborns who have been exposed to drugs during pregnancy. Ice is now the number one illicit drug they're dealing with at the specialist pregnancy service. ""We should be paying attention to this across the nation â€¦ this is something that happens in every community,"" Elvira says. ""Before a baby is born, the mum is this baby's entire life support system and the more we can support a mum to reduce or perhaps even stop her drug use, the better the outcomes are gonna be for this baby. ""It is an excellent form of investment in the health of future generations to support women before they are pregnant and during their pregnancy."" Terrianne is proud of how far she has come. ""I never ever thought I would make it. Never ever thought I would come out of addiction. Never ever thought I would have this beautiful child in my arms,"" she says. ""I don't like to use the word perfect, but he's pretty perfect."" Alysha knows her drug use in the early stages of the pregnancy may have effects on her daughter. ""I'll have to live with that,"" Alysha says. ""But this baby girl seems to be very strong and she's made it this far and I feel like she'll make it to the end and we'll be OK. We're in the right place."" Watch Breaking the CycleÂ on Four Corners now onÂ ABC iview.

ir76,"The volatile lives behind Australia's booming cocaine trade. The man in the balaclava finishes scanning the Melbourne townhouse for listening devices. There's a knock at the door. In walks a hulking figure wearing a ski mask, sunglasses and a camouflage raincoat. Jason* unzips his bag, takes out the corner of a cocaine brick and sits it on a dinner plate. The crumbly white rock is worth roughly $50,000. The smell of fumes drifts across the room â€” a by-product of the petrol used to process it. ""We've sold to football players, professional athletes, lawyers, celebrities on TV, people in the media â€¦ surgeons, doctors, nurses,"" he says. It's so ubiquitous, even those meant to be upholding the law are using cocaine. ""â€‹â€‹I've personally seen judges take it with a glass of single malt."" Jason is a trafficker operating at the highest levels of organised crime. He deals kilos of cocaine a week. He's never been caught. The high-grade cocaine sitting next to him could be sold on the streets for up to $600 per gram â€” six times what he paid for it wholesale. He's in a lucrative market. Australians are the highest per capita users of cocaine in the world â€“ 4.2 per cent of Australians aged 14Â and over used cocaine in 2019 â€“ and as an island nation, pay some of the highest prices globally. We'reÂ in the middle of an unprecedented cocaine boom. In just the four months between November and February, authorities seized almost 7.5 tonnes of cocaine destined for our streets. That's 3Â tonnes more than the previous annual record for cocaine seizures in Australia. To understand how this shadow economy works, Four Corners met with people across the cocaine supply chain, from street dealers all the way to the highest-level operators like Jason. They reveal a world of big money and big risk, power and paranoia. Verifying what they say is hard, but what they describe stacks up with the public record and what people in the underworld have told the ABC. For some, this is breaking a code of silence in an industry regulated by violence. In Australia, the dealers selling to consumers are generally operating at the bottom of the supply chain. One of these street dealers agrees to meet at an apartment complex in west Melbourne. He comes to the door wearing a mask and never removes it. ""This is just one of my three stash houses,"" the dealer says. ""We're just waiting for my main supplier to come and drop off what I need."" Over an encrypted app, he places an order for four ounces of cocaine. He then posts on Snapchat, Wickr and Signal, letting his customers know he's ""on for the week"". The dealer is a solo operator, running cocaine direct to consumers and supplying other dealers with diluted or ""cut"" product. He works with a couple of different mid-tier drug traffickers who claim to be associated with outlaw motorcycle clubs. ""When I was young, I grew up in housing commission and I saw dealing as like a way out. I saw my mates doing it, and how they started making money fast, buying cars, and nice clothes and stuff. I thought, 'F***Â if these guys can do it, why not me?'"" While he waits for his order to be dropped off, he prepares ""cutters"" â€” fake cocaine that he uses to dilute the drug and ""rip off"" clients. The dealer crushes Panadol into a fine powder before spraying it with hairspray until it forms clumps. He then wraps it in plastic film and compresses the powder with the bottom of a perfume bottle. This will be mixed with the product he gets to maximise his profits, or he'll bag it up and sell it to people he doesn't know in a nightclub or bar. ""Probably got around a gram and a half there of Panadol. So I'd charge about $650 if I'm doing a rip,"" he says. It's not just clients he's willing to rip off. He receives another message from a mid-tier supplier offering a cocaine bargain. ""He reckons it's A-grade. Selling it for 5,200 an ounce."" It's a suspiciously low price. ""I can tell he's probably trying to rip me but we're going to do him one over before he can get us."" He hatches a plan to send in a crew to steal the coke. ""My guy sits in the car, has a chat with him. Builds the trust a little bit, just pulls out a gun when he least expects it and goes 'give me everything now'. Pretty simple."" The dealer shows video of two guns he recently purchased. ""For a clean one, you're looking at anywhere from $18,000 to $28,000 depending on what it is. Dirty, you can buy them for $4,000 toÂ $8,000 depending on who it is and how dirty they are. These ones have been used a fair bit though."" The dealer is caught in the tussle of a volatile lifestyle. At every turn, he feels as though he has everything to gain and everything to lose. His own cocaine habit costs him $4,000 to $5,000 a week. ""At my worst, I was probably going through an eight ball [an eighth of an ounce] every day for about 3-4 years straight. Every single day. Just to get through the day. ""You can f***Â your life up pretty quick.â€¯Thinking people are trying to set me up. Causing a lot of fights and arguments in my relationships, friendships, yeah, it's just a downhill spiral.â€¯ ""But you love the feeling so much you just keep doing it.""â€¯ Remy* wraps a Burberry scarf around her neck and makes her way to the train station in Sydney's leafy north shore. She works in a high-powered role in sales, dines at upmarket restaurants and is looking to add a new Rolex to her collection. When Remy first entered the corporate world, it opened a whole new market for her other business â€” cocaine. ""I realised that working in the corporate world and working in cocaine, really worked well together,"" Remy says. ""I started to network, go for the after-work drinks, hang out with the managing directors, meet their managing director friends â€” some of the biggest coke heads I've ever met. ""So most days, I'd [do] up deals on my lunch breaks."" What became a glamorous double life started as a fight for survival. Remy's conservative Lebanese childhood was turned upside down when she was just 12 years old. ""I had one wall that was completely decked out with Alyssa Milano from Charmed [who] at the time was my celebrity crush. ""I started to dress in a more tomboyish type of way. I started to take on a bit more of a masculine persona."" One night, Remy's stepdad went through her phone and read flirty messages with her girlfriend. She was told to: ""Pack a bag and get out."" In her desperation, she went to the only place she felt safe â€” a 24-hour diner in Parramatta where she found solace beneath the cameras. Remy eventually met an older woman she describes as a ""mother hen"" who offered to help her make money. ""I was taught the basics of how to survive and how to get by, which obviously meant I felt I had a certain level of loyalty and I had to repay her."" By age 13, she was selling cocaine and rapidly climbing the ranks. During this time, Remy was repeatedly stabbed, bashed and sexually assaulted. The trauma still haunts her. ""I had a gun rammed into my mouth so hard that I had an already sort of chipped tooth in the back of my mouth knocked â€¦ clean out of my mouth."" Moving to the corporate world brought Remy safety and access to new customers, but also new problems. She became addicted to the money and to hard drugs herself. ""You feel invincible. You've got all this money. But you can have 100 grand one night and be $250,000 in debt the next week."" For more than five years, Remy kept up her double life â€” selling coke to wealthy professionals during her work hours. At just one corporate event, she says she could turn over $15,000. ""I just see dollars, dollars, dollars. That's another street thing. I'm very, very money focused because it's about changing our narrative and our generational wealth."" By the time Remy was in her early twenties, she knew she wanted out of the cocaine business â€” but it wasn't easy or quick. ""Being able to step away from that much money and go, 'Is it worth it long-term?' is a question that you eventually have to ask yourself,"" she says. ""Do you want to live a life of crime and potentially be in and out of jail your whole life and dealing with scumbags your whole life?"" In the murky world of cocaine trafficking, there are operators who believe it is worth the long-term commitment. Jason breaks open the corner of a cocaine brick. ""It has a particular sheen to it. A lot of people call that pearl or mother of pearl,"" he says. ""The percentage is in the mid-80s. You don't really see anything in the 90s. The final product on the street, during COVID, was as low as 5Â per cent, and after COVID it's generally around 50 per cent cut on the street."" Jason has been dealing for 30 years and operates at the highest levels. In order to survive for as long as he has, he subscribes to a code. ""I work with people that have a code. A code that defines how they work. Some people break the code, they talk, or violent people take things too far. If you can get down to the human level, tell people I'm giving them my word, money for good product, there will be no trouble. ""Sometimes you have to project strength. In this industry you need the combination of being respected, in a loving way, and a little bit of fear but not too much."" He saysÂ there haveÂ only been two occasions in which he has had guns pulled on him. ""If someone pulls a gun on you, they're generally trying to scare you. If someone pulls a gun and they're going to use it, you won't see it."" He hasn't been caught by law enforcement either. He is well-versed in digital hygiene, police surveillance and management in the drugs business. Jason, who had a balaclava-clad associate scan for listening devices, doesn't let us keep an audio recording of the interview. Caution comes with the territory. ""When you're dealing with higher amounts of quality cocaine, it's always done by introduction. You have to be vetted. You have to work your way up. At a certain level, there's heaps of paranoia. When we're dealing with the millions,"" Jason says. Three years ago, Australian Federal Police targeted a so-called ""Aussie Cartel"" of nine traffickers the authorities believed were responsible for about 30 per cent of all drug importations, worth billions of dollars. Jason says that isn't the case anymore, and these days the industry has splintered into a growing number of smaller syndicates. ""The cartel that you're talking about, their traditional lines were taken out by the encrypted apps that the police made. A lot of the bigger players got taken out and the traditional ways of getting cocaine into the country was compromised so there's new ways and different people on the scene."" As Australia's appetite for cocaine grows, dealers and traffickers like Jason are getting on with the business of meeting that demand. There is a cost. A recent Australian study linked cocaine to almost 400 deaths in the past five years. Jason justifies his role, saying he's like a ""well-paid Uber Eats driver"". ""I get it from a line to the person, with the least amount of trouble as possible,"" he says. ""If I can give you something that you want for a reasonable rate but good quality, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong. As long as I'm doing my part, I can sleep well."" *Names and some identifying details have been altered.

ir77,"When Jana Pittman opened up about her incontinence on national television, she had no idea the response it would evoke.Â  The three-time Olympian and World Championship hurdle winner and now-doctor,Â shared her experience with incontinence during her time on SAS Australia, breaking a years-long silence on the matter that had brought her so much shame. TheÂ public response was overwhelming, she said.Â  ""In hindsight, it was a bit of embarrassment but the outcome was thousands and thousands of women writing to me, saying how theyâ€™d had the same. They were going to get help.â€� Speaking to ABC News in the lead-up to World Continence Week, Pittman is a mother of six and has battled with incontinence for many years.Â  In 2007, seven months after giving birth to her first child, she competed at the World Championships. â€œWhen I had my first child, I trained very hard through my pregnancy and came back too quickly â€“ I was back running within a couple of days of giving birth and just not aware of the impact on the pelvic floor without seeing a physio,â€� PittmanÂ said.Â  â€œDespite that, I went over and won the World Championships in Osaka, about eight months later. Pittman remembers struggling on camera, pouring water over herself to hide the fact that she was wetting herself during the races. ""I had a terrible accident every time I raced. Itâ€™s a lot of impact, thatâ€™s a hard 400m race and you jump over barriers along the way. I was far too embarrassed to admit it, when I was only 23 years of age. â€œSo, I really kept it hidden, I didnâ€™t tell anyone.â€�Â  Later in life, Pittman was speaking at a conference, talking to women about balance and getting the best out of themselves. â€œIn that setting, they basically said to me, after I admitted that I had that incontinence episode, I realised that Iâ€™d been doing a disservice to fellow women by pretending that it didnâ€™t happen,"" she said. ""I wasÂ trying to be this superhero as a mother coming back to elite sport when actually what people needed to see was the realness behind having had children and not training the pelvic floor the right way.â€� In 2021, Jana was a contestant in SAS Australia, a reality show that puts participants through gruelling physical challenges. It was here that she was candid about incontinence on a public platform.Â  Following a hard 5km run, burpees, squats and jumps, Pittman felt herself fatiguing, and she became unable to hold on with her bladder.Â  ""I was running along and I thought â€˜god, this is going to be so embarrassingâ€™."" Pittman had given birth again just five-and-a-half months prior to the show; andÂ decided to share her plight with SAS Australia's audience.Â  ""I was thinking â€˜well, I could own this or I could not. This is a chance, are you going to be brave and own it or say nothing?â€™"" Following the exercise, Pittman had her head bowed on the show, whispering to a fellow contestant,Â ""I just pissed myself on that run"".Â  She followed up with an impassioned warning for women viewing the incident.Â  ""Women at home need to know that after you have a baby you don't have a good pelvic floor if you try hard,"" she said on the show.Â  Speaking to the ABC, she said she considered hiding it on the show â€”Â but chose not to. ""I could have hidden it, no one would have known, just like I did the World Championships 10 years previously. ""But I thought, if I donâ€™t own this space, if Iâ€™m not honest and confident about it, how are other women going to get help?"" Pittman is now 40 and is working as a junior doctor, workingÂ to specialise in obstetrics and gynaecology.Â  Reflecting on her first pregnancy, sheÂ saidÂ the impact of the exercise she maintained during the final trimester was too intensive on her pelvic floor, which caused the damage leading to incontinence.Â  ""Iâ€™m a huge advocate for women keeping fit and active and training during pregnancy, Iâ€™m with most of the obstetricians in Australia that now advocate for women doing similar to what they did pre-pregnancy, providing you havenâ€™t got a high-risk pregnancy,"" she said. ""There are certain levels of activity that do not serve you or your baby, and I did that."" Pittman said she continued training throughout her first pregnancy and up until just before she gave birth. ""Iâ€™d thumped and thudded and hurdled and jumped and lifted heavy weights, right up until I gave birth and that I think is why I ended up with a levator ani injury,Â which is a muscle injury in my pelvic floor."" She has found ways to live with her incontinence, seeing a pelvic floor physiotherapist and using continence aids including Australian brand Modi Bodi, founded by an Aussie mum who also suffered incontinence. ""To be honest, I can jump on a trampoline now, and sneeze without discomfort â€”Â as long as I keep up with my physio activities.""Â  Pittman is also positioned well to advocate for the issueÂ as sheâ€™s working to be qualified as an obstetrician as well as her lived experience with the issues. â€œI really see this as my space, I feel there are so many taboo topics in womenâ€™s health and we just need to talk about them,"" she said. ""If we can make one woman feel better about her body and love the skin she's in, then we've made a huge difference.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-06-22/incontinence-jana-pittman-continence-week/102435624
ir78,"Vanuatu's parliament has elected Sato Kilman as the Pacific Island nation's new prime minister. Mr Kilman, who has previously been prime minister of Vanuatu on four occasions, was elected 27 votes to 23 in a secret ballot on Monday after a court upheld the results of a no-confidence motion againstÂ Ishmael Kalsakau.Â  The outgoing prime minister appeared to have narrowly survived a no-confidence motion brought by Opposition Leader Bob Loughman nearly three weeks ago. The parliamentary speaker initially found the opposition fell one vote short, but last week the Supreme Court ruled the opposition had in fact won the motion of no confidence. The no-confidence motion garnered 26 votes, compared to 23 votes against, but the parliament's speaker said it failed to win the absolute majority of 27 to remove a prime minister in the 52-seat parliament. But as one seat is vacant and one MP did not attend the session due to illness, Supreme Court Judge Edwin Goldsbrough ruled that an absolute majority in a parliament with 51 members is 26. The parliament Speaker, Seoule Simeon, lodged an appeal against that decision, but on Monday, the Court of Appeal ruled against him. Sato Kilman, a former prime minister and leader of the People's Progressive Party, was chosen by the opposition as its candidate for prime minister when parliament satÂ at 5pm, local broadcaster VBTC reported. Mr Kilman expelled 12 Australian Federal Police from Vanuatu in 2012 while prime ministerÂ after he was stopped while transiting through an Australian airport and his adviser was arrested by Australian police on tax fraud charges. A police commissioner before entering politics, Mr Kilman served as deputy prime minister in Mr Kalsakau's government until May, when he was removed from cabinet. The Pacific Island nation has been perceived as being caught up in a geopolitical tussle between China and the West. But other political commentators point to domestic issues as the reasons for the no-confidence motion, such as opposition to a proposed rise in the minimum wage. Vanuatu's local economy has been struggling and parts of the nation are still recovering after twin cyclones earlier this year. Mr Kalsakau has served as prime minister since November last year, following two weeks of negotiations of elected MPs to form government. His government won international attention this year for its successful push to get the United Nations General Assembly to ask the world's top court to define the obligations of states to combat climate change. In December last year, Australia and Vanuatu signed a bilateral security agreement, which was expected to increase military, policing and cybersecurity co-operation between the two countries. Mr Loughman, who drew Vanuatu closer to China during his time as the previous prime minister, has said the security pact with Australia compromised Vanuatu's ""neutral"" status and could jeopardise development assistance from China. The no-confidence motion stated, as quoted in The Guardian:Â ""Prime Minister Maau'koro [Kalsakau] without the authorisation from the Council of Ministers did proceed to execute the Security Pact with a development partner."" The motion did not name Australia directly, but it is the only country Mr Kalsakau has signed a security pact with during his tenure. ""The Hon Prime Minister and his Government must conduct its relations impartially and not allow our independent and sovereign nation to be sucked into a game it does not want and to be used inappropriately by competing nations to exert dominance in our region."" Last week China sent police experts to Vanuatu amid the political crisis, and the Vanuatu police force said it would work with ""all partners"", including Australia, New Zealand and China. China has signed a security pact with neighbouring Solomon Islands, causing concern among some Western nations about Beijing's rising influence in the Pacific.

ir80,"Australia said on Sunday it would send additional police to the Solomon Islands to boost security for the Pacific Games in November, keeping them there until June to assist with a general election. The extended Australian police presence comes after the Solomon Islands upgraded ties with China, signing a policing agreement in July. Australia, New Zealand and the United States are concerned Chinese police could dislodge a long-standing security arrangement Canberra has with the Pacific Islands nation. However, the Solomon Islands said on Friday it had invited Australia to extend the police presence, originally due to end in December. Australia was the Pacific Islands nation's ""primary security partner"", a spokesperson for Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement.Â  The Australian police will work alongside officers from Fiji, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. ""At the request of the Solomon Islands government, Australia has extended its contribution to the Solomons International Assistance Force until June 2024 to assist with security for the national general elections,"" the statement said. The Australian police contingent arrived in December 2021 to quell anti-government riots, while Chinese police trainers arrived this year to prepare for the games. More than 5,000 athletes from two dozen nations are expected to attend the games, for which China has donated and constructed stadiums and other venues. China stepped up its funding for infrastructure after Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in 2019. The Solomon Islands last year signed a security pact with China, raising concern in Canberra and Washington about Beijing's naval ambitions.

ir81,"Belvoir's 2024 season will be a ""gift"" for audiences, says artistic director Eamon Flack, who has designed a distinctly accessible program headlined by tried and tested audience favourites â€” including new productions of Broadway and West End juggernaut The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, and Tracy Letts's Pulitzer Prize-winning American hit August: Osage County. Sydney has previously seen blockbuster productions of both: The National Theatre's Olivier and Tony award-winning adaptation of Mark Haddon's novel toured Australia in 2018, while the original Steppenwolf Theatre Company production of August: Osage County was a crowning jewel of Sydney Theatre Company's 2010 season. Belvoir audiences can expect scaled-down stagings of both these international behemoths, to fit the intimate 330-seat Surry Hills theatre, with its idiosyncratic corner-style stage. The casts, however, will be hefty: eight for Curious Incident, led by rising star Daniel R. Nixon, and 13 for August: Osage County, led by Pamela Rabe (Wentworth; Deadloch). The crowning jewel of Belvoir's 2024 season, meanwhile, is a homegrown juggernaut: Counting and Cracking, the epic Sri Lankan Australian family saga first staged by Belvoir in 2019 (as part of Sydney Festival), will return to Sydney, following a successful UK tour in August 2022, during which it earned a 5-star review from The Times. The multigenerational, transcontinental saga, which was inspired by the family of its writer and associate director S. Shakthidharan, is one of the most ambitious pieces of Australian theatre in recent years, with a cast of 19 (including three on-stage musicians) and a run-time of more than 3.5 hours. That ambition was rewarded: Counting and Cracking's Sydney and Adelaide seasons sold out, and the show won a staggering seven Helpmann Awards, as well as the $100,000 Victorian Prize for Literature (Australia's richest literary prize). Belvoir has been looking to remount it since then, with the most obvious obstacle being the COVID lockdowns, and the second being a dearth of suitable local venues for the massive show. When Fergus Linehan, who had programmed Counting and Cracking at the 2022 Edinburgh International Festival, was announced in May as the incoming CEO of Carriageworks, the stars aligned; the show will open there in June 2024, with most of the original key cast returning. Another tried-and-tested local hit making its return is Holding The Man, playwright Tommy Murphy's adaptation of Timothy Conigrave's much-loved 1995 memoir of life, love and death during Australia's AIDS crisis, which was first at Belvoir in 2007, and has become a contemporary Australian classic (it was subsequently adapted for screen, helmed by Belvoir's former artistic director, Neil Armfield). Flack, who auditioned for the original stage adaptation, says the book and play are close to his heart. ""I think for a lot of gay men, that book has a very deep resonance: That could have been me."" But he says time has revealed a different side to the story: ""I think, actually, it's a history of Australia in the 70s and 80s, told through the life and death of two gay men."" It's also an inherently joyful play, says Flack: ""The theatrical game of the piece is a lot more joyful than the film [version], where everything is presented literally. The offer that Tommy [Murphy] made [by having] six actors playing all the roles, is [about] remembering that this story is actually full of joy, not just about someone dying."" Flack cited cost of living pressures as one factor informing Belvoir's 2024 season. ""It's a really whacked time, and there's a lot on people's minds. And so we were like, 'Let's just kind of make it a very generous [season] next year,"" he told ABC. ""We want to make it very easy for people to come to, and love, theatre."" There's a strand of feel-good plays: Anita Heiss's adaptation of her ""chick lit"" novel of female friendship, Tiddas, coming to Belvoir following a popular season at Brisbane's La Boite in September 2022; Carmel Dean's song cycle Well-Behaved Women, in which four local powerhouses (including Ursula Yovich and Zahra Newman) embody women of history â€” from Cleopatra to Cathy Freeman; and Nia Vardalos's popular hit Tiny Beautiful Things, based on Cheryl Strayed's memoir about her time as an anonymous online ""agony aunt"". Tiny Beautiful Things is coming to Belvoir from Queensland Theatre, where it opened in July, starring Mandy McElhinney as Cheryl Strayed: the ex-heroin addict turned author, who is perhaps best known for her New York Times bestseller Wild (based on her experience trekking the Pacific Crest Trail), which was further popularised by Reese Witherspoon's 2014 film adaptation. The stage adaptation of Tiny Beautiful Things, by My Big Fat Greek Wedding star Nia Vardalos, premiered Off-Broadway in 2016, and went on to become a sell-out hit. A screen adaptation by Witherspoon's company Hello Sunshine premiered in April 2023, winning critical acclaim. Belvoir has been eyeing the show for some time: ""We had been close to doing it in the past,"" says Flack. ""The way [Cheryl Strayed] uses her own life, and her own stories, in order to try and offer other people some wisdom, is incredibly beautiful â€” and really heroic, actually."" Rounding out the season is a trio of new Australian plays by emerging writers: Mandela Mathia's autobiographical one-man show Lose to Win; Grace Chapple'sÂ friendship dramaÂ Never Closer, set during the Troubles in Ireland, and inspired by her mother and aunt; and Nithya Nagarajan and Liv Satchell's show Nayika: A Dancing Girl, inspired by and starring Vaishnavi Suryaprakash (who won a Helpmann Award for her role in Counting and Cracking),Â a highly skilled Bharatanatyam dancer. The first two come to Belvoir's main stage after previous iterations: A version of Mathia's show, which was developed as part of the company's COVID-response program Artists At Work, showed at the Old Fitz theatre in Woolloomooloo in 2022; and Never Closer, which premiered on the downstairs stage last year, directed by Belvoir's resident director Hannah Goodwin, will transfer upstairs with the same cast. Flack, who saw Never Closer twice last year, says: ""It was the most accomplished all-round piece of writing, directing, ensemble acting [and] staging that I had seen in a really, really long time."" And while Belvoir's 2024 season is dominated by big shows and established hits, Flack says it's these new Australian works, and emerging voices and talents, that are crucial for the company's success. ""Theatre is an estate that has to be [tended]; we have to keep it alive, we have to keep growing artists,"" he says. ""And that's actually the way forward.""

This weekend, Greta Gerwig's Barbie, produced by and starring Australian actress Margot Robbie, became the highest-grossing film of 2023 with over $US1.38 billion ($2.13 billion) globally. The title was previously held by The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which was released in Australia back in April. It's the latest in a growing list of records set by the film, which became Warner Bros. highest-grossing film of all time just last week. It toppled Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II, which earned $US1,342,359,942 (not adjusted for inflation). Back in August, Barbie passed the BarbillionÂ milestone when it reached $US1 billion at the box office, with experts calling its relentless marketing campaign ""a masterclass."" The BarbillionÂ milestone saw Barbie become the first billion-dollar film from a solo female director writing Greta Gerwig into the history books. Its opening weekend also smashed records, earning Barbie the title of the biggest US opening weekend for the year with $US162 million, and the biggest opening weekend of all time for a female director. Meanwhile, Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer has sailed past $US850 million globally to become the third highest-grossing film of the year. The consistent box office figures have delivered Nolan his third highest-grossing film of all time, behind 2008â€²s The Dark Knight and 2012â€²s The Dark Knight Rises. The continued success of both Barbie and Oppenheimer comes at a fraught time for Hollywood, with actors seven weeks into a strike for fair contracts with major entertainment companies and movie theatres bracing for a somewhat depleted autumn season as a result. Despite the strikes, both the Venice and Toronto film festivals are currently underway, though with fewer stars making an appearance. Director David Fincher, promoting his new film The Killer, told the Venice Film Festival he ""can understand both sides"" of the joint actors and writers' strike. ""I don't know what it says about the industry. I'm very sad, obviously I sit in the middle of both parties,"" he said, as reported in Variety. ""This movie was made during the pandemic and I never want to make a movie with a visor again. ""But having said that, [we] just got done with three years of having to set our brushes down and walk away â€” the idea of that continuing on, especially now, is very sad to me.

Acute liver failure develops quickly and is a medical emergency that can cause serious complications and requires hospitalisation. In some cases, it can only be cured via a liver transplant. Chronic liver failure develops at a slower rate. Without treatment, both can lead to death. Harwell is 56. The news comesÂ years after troubling footage emerged of HarwellÂ appearing disorientated during a 2019 live performance in Syracuse, New York. He announced his retirementÂ in 2021.

ir84,"Cartoonist Alan McClure continues to create art decades after finding humour in news stories for Sydney Morning Herald readers.Â  McClure who turned 100 on August 23Â celebrated the milestone with a week-long party filled with homemade sausage rolls and good company. ""I married my wife because of these sausage rolls,"" McClure said. ""It took me a while to get here [turning 100 years old] but I can thank my wonderful wife for that."" Born in Stanthorpe in southern Queensland, McClure served as a gun layer in World War II, before heading to Europe and meeting his future wife, Alicia. While in London McClure began a career in cartooning for a children's book illustrator in 1949. McClure who continues to dote on his wife,Â marriedÂ now 91-year-old Alicia in 1953 and had three children.Â  His daughter Karel Bell said it was not until he moved back to Australia and started at the Sydney Morning Herald in 1964 that his career skyrocketed. ""Dad's career became prominent when he got to Sydney, that was probably the busiest time of his life,"" Mrs Bell said. ""He was at the [Sydney Morning] Herald and the Courier Mail whilst creating book covers, it was all happening."" McClure never formally studied art but he said he took inspiration from everyday situations. ""I might've never learnt it but I always knew how to do it,"" McClure said. ""I think I just have the mind for it [creativity], I was drawing a cartoon every week from things I saw or did."" Mrs Bell said her father's life was still full of art. ""Often when I get home from work there he is still painting away in the garage,"" she said. ""The other day, he asked for a pen and paper and drew a man we saw playing the piano, it's just what he does,"" she said.

ir85,"Mara theÂ Labrador puppy might just challenge the notion that cats alone possessÂ nine lives. The inquisitive black puppy caused her 14-year-old owner Hugh McMullan more than his fair share of heartache, when she strayed from her familyÂ during an afternoon spentÂ foraging in Central Victoria.Â  The McMullans were hiking among the grassy green hills of their hometown of Maldon for Father'sÂ Day, when Mara went missing.Â  They split-up to search for the young dog, immediately fearing the worse.Â  ""IÂ was really worried and nervous because she always comes when she's called,"" Hugh said. ""You can always hear her collar jangling but it was silent and I couldn't hear anything."" Hugh followed his nose and searched down a hill where he spotted a grassy mound, which he knew to be the top of an abandoned mineshaft.Â  His worst fears were confirmed when he peered in, and saw a dark, wet nose and heard the sound of whimpering.Â  ""I called her name and she looked up, and I just got super worried at that point because I thought, I don't know how to get her out,"" he said.Â  Hugh urgently called his parents to the mound and they rushed to his side.Â  At this point, the 14-year-old was quite distressed.Â  His mother, Anna Robb, called emergency services â€”Â mainly to try and calm Hugh down.Â  ""IÂ was really surprised becauseÂ I didn't actually think that they would â€¦ respond,"" Ms Robb said.Â  ""I was really calling because I could see how upset he was and that he really needed someone to come and help or that he needed an answer to help him be able to rescue his dog."" Mere minutes later, a siren was blasting from the local CFA â€” and what felt like a cast of thousands swarmed on the hill.Â Â  Safety precautions were taken and the scene was assessed.Â It was indeed an old mine shaft, about 25 metres deep.Â  A team of rescuers were slowly lowered down the hole, and after some nervous moments, a black, wriggling labrador appeared. A palpable sense of relief swamped the family when Mara reappeared and started running laps of the rescue grounds. Despite her tumultuous fall down the mineshaft, she escaped without any major injuries.Â  Hugh quickly scooped up his best mate and took her back to the car, where the pair cuddled for 15 minutes straight.Â  It seems Mara's off-leash foraging days are over. ""I'm going to sleep with her every night and make sure she doesn't run away anymore,"" Hugh said. ""I might have to take her to school with me."" Hugh's mum, Ms Robb, revealedÂ abashedly that prior to the dog's disappearance, her son had chastised her throughout the walk for not having Mara on a lead. She said the sense of community and spirit around the rescue was astonishing. ""I just I could not thank the people who came enough,"" she said. ""All of this for one little dog and one little boy. ""The crews were amazing, so skilled and amazing. We're just so thankful.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-05/mara-labrador-puppy-rescue-mineshaft-maldon-cfa-ses/102813500
ir86,"For nearlyÂ six months, the Pride of the Murray has been sitting on the bottom of a river in outback Queensland, hidden beneath its muddy brown waters. It's an ignominious resting place for the 99-year-old wooden paddle wheeler, which attracted national headlines when it was trucked nearly 1,750 kilometres from country Victoria to Longreach in May 2022. This week, an expected five-day operation will begin to salvage the 24-metre, 100-tonne vessel from where it has rested since March 6. The paddle wheelerÂ sunk at its mooringÂ just weeks out from the start of peak tourist season.Â  Pride of the Murray owner and Longreach-based tourism operation Outback Pioneers estimate it will cost more than $1.5 million to preserve and restore the iconic attraction. Built in 1924 as a barge to tow other boats and later converted into a vessel to transport timber on the Murray River in Echuca, the paddle wheeler has had a colourful history. This is not the first time the boat has sat at the bottom of a waterway after being intentionally sunk in the Murray River at the end of its working life in the 1960s. In 1973, the C24 barge was purchased for $100 from its underwater grave by Captain Maxwell Carrington. After removing 250 tonnesÂ of silt, she was refloated, repaired and relaunched four years later as the Pride of the Murray to be used as a diesel-electric passenger vessel, becoming an iconic tourist attraction. Last year, Pride of the Murray was purchased by Outback Pioneers, a Longreach-based tourism operation, and transported overland from Victoria, through outback New South Wales to her new home on the Thomson River. After the epic journey, the Pride of the Murray was a popular tourist attraction for the remaining few months of the outback tourist season. As fundraising efforts begin to help raise money to restore the boat, owner Richard Kinnon said he wantedÂ to conserve the piece of Australian history. ""The Pride of the Murray means so much to me after all we've done to bring her to Longreach, and we have a duty to preserve her if it is humanly possible,"" he said. Maritime Safety Queensland will create an exclusion zone around the salvage site from September 4 to 10Â to allow public boating traffic to move around the works safely. General manager Kell Dillon said he was sure that residents and boaties would be delighted to see the boat raised from the bottom of the river. ""This will return the river to its natural state and remove a potential safety hazard for other vessels,"" Mr Dillon said. ""It's important that while work progresses, the boating public keeps well clear of the salvors and their equipment in the interest of everyone's safety. ""I encourage all local boaties to make themselves familiar with the gazetted exclusion zone."" Longreach Regional Council Mayor Tony Rayner said the paddle wheeler could not remain at the bottom of the Thomson River. ""We're very pleased that a salvage crew has been appointed to refloat the Pride of the Murray as such,"" Cr Rayner said. ""That will then give them the opportunity to do their assessments as to what they'll do with it once they get it out of the river.""",information retrieval,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-04/sunken-pride-of-the-murray-paddle-wheeler-raised-thomson-river/102793632
ir87,"The value of Australia's crop, livestock and fisheries production is expected to remain strongÂ despite the outlook for drier conditions this season, according to the national commodity forecaster. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences' (ABARES) latest commodities report forecasts production at $80 billion, the third highest on record, coming off an all-time high of $92Â billion last season. At $65 billion, food and fibre exports are predicted to be 17 per cent lower than 2022â€“23 figures due to falling commodity prices, particularly for livestock, and lower production. The ABARES report estimates Australian grain growers will produce 45.2 million tonnes, which isÂ slightly below the 10-year average, for crops such as wheat, barley, canola and chickpeas. ""As we come out of a higher rainfall La NiÃ±a period and move into a drier El NiÃ±o climate, it is expected that below-average rainfall and warmer temperatures will reduce Australian crop yields and production from the previous year's record highs,"" ABARES executive director Dr Jared Greenville said. ""Total crop production value is set to fall 20 per cent in 2023â€“24 to $46 billion."" Drier conditions in northern growing regions will see Australian wheat production drop by 36 per cent to 25.4 million tonnes, barley down 26 per cent to 10.5 million tonnes and canola down 38 per cent to 5.2 million tonnes, ABARES forecasts. Production of these crops is expected to fall in all winter grain-producing states except Victoria. In a separate report, Rabobank grains and oilseeds senior analyst Dennis Voznesenski said that while some areas of the grain belts were struggling, others were on track for a good season. ""The inland central/north WA cropping belt and northern NSW/QLD are concerning dry, but favourable conditions elsewhere are balancing out the national crop number,"" he said in the bank's monthly agribusiness report. Livestock prices at saleyards around the country have been sliding for months now, and the forecast forÂ drier conditions ahead will only see that trend continue, according to ABARES. ""As supply increases, saleyard prices for cattle and sheep are expected to fall,"" Dr Greenville said, adding that sheep prices were forecast to fall below their long-term average. ""At the same time, global meat prices are falling. ""These factors will mean, despite higher production volumes, the value of livestock production is expected to fall by $1.6 billion to $34 billion in 2023â€“24."" The Eastern Young Cattle Indicator, an index of cattle sales on the east coast, dropped 40 per cent in the year to July 2023. But while cattle prices have stabilised in recent months, sheep pricesÂ have been sliding all year.

ir88,"A well-known quote gave Hayley and Caleb Downs the impetus they needed to turn their lives upside down â€” ""you only get 18 summers with your kids"". ""It just gripped me by my heart,"" Mr Downs said. Up until three months ago the couple lived a ""comfortable"" life with their three children aged 5, 3, and 8Â months, a short drive from Queensland's capital. It was a life they thought they wanted, and to pay for itÂ Ms Downs was a paediatric nurse while Mr Downs worked long, gruelling hours in the child safety industry. But they were at breaking point. ""You work all week so hard to pay the mortgage, keep things going, just to do the day-to-day and you miss out on those moments, and just life in general,"" Mr Downs said. ""You might be present in your body, but you've got your mind thinking a million other things.""Â  SoÂ fitting whatever they could into their car and caravan, and selling the rest, the family of five drove away from their Caboolture home and headed straight to the edge of the outback. ""No shipping container, no storage. We own nothing,"" Mr Downs said. They're now caretakers of a sprawling 10,000-hectare property, where the nearest town is Injune and the closest landmark is Carnarvon Gorge. Out hereÂ the landscape is spectacularly rugged and mostly occupied by cattle graziers. ""The traffic is awesome. Sometimes you don't see a car for the two hours it takes to get off the dirt road,"" Ms Downs said. ""The closest store of some sort is over two hours away and we go just over three hours to get our groceries."" The Downs family didn't take a sudden interest in farming. Rather, they reshuffled their lives to prioritise what matters most. ""We made the decision to take this small windowÂ which can seem massive at the moment and exhausting because we've got three young kids, and the sleepless nights,"" Mr Downs said. ""But I understand I will be wishing this back, and we needed to grasp a hold of this and take this opportunity."" Mr Downs said working in the child safety industry, where the number of young people in need kept growing, showed him how critical raising his own family was. ""I can't be helping or trying to provide support for families if I can't even be present for my own,"" he said. ""I want my boys and my daughter to be men and women who have the right morals and the right values and not what I'm reading and what I'm seeing."" The Downs'Â original plan was to travel around Australia in a caravan, but then theÂ manager of a cattle station offered them an opportunity they couldn't turn down. The family gets paid to live on and maintain the remote property. ""It's definitely the best decision we've made for a long time,"" Ms Downs said. ""We do a lot of exploring the place together because there's 25,000 acres [10,000 hectares] here."" For five-year-old Jaxson and his three-year-old brother OakleyÂ the creek that snakes through the entrance to their property has quickly become their favourite spot in their gigantic playground. ""Then we find all cows and all the wallabies,"" Oakley added. The move hasn't come without a few hiccups and adjustments, like having no phone reception ""a few steps outside the house"". ""Not having the luxury and the convenience of going to the shops every few days because the kids ate all this or I forgot something,"" Ms Downs said. ""The closest hospital that would be able to do anything is over three hours away. ""It will take the ambulance about two and a half hours to get here if we needed someone."" Ms Downs has also taken on the added role of teacher to their eldest son. ""I've never had any intentions of homeschooling my kids beforehand, but we have all day so we can take as long as we need,"" she said. Even making a cup of coffee isn't as simple as flicking on the kettle anymore. ""I'm getting a bit more confident with getting the fire started, splitting the wood with the axe,"" Ms Downs said. Mr Downs has had his fair share of learning curves too, some days working as a contractor doing odd farming jobs. ""I've found myself getting bogged and had to end up walking 10 kilometres to get back to the station house to get contact â€” just because you've got no phone reception,"" he said. But the family is soaking in the experiences its new life allows. ""We were wanting to see confidence built in our children. But what I didn't realise is that being in suburbiaÂ the comforts had withdrawn our own confidence,"" Mr Downs said. ""Since we've been hereÂ I've just seen that explode in what we're capable of doing or even putting ourselves out to do."" While they have no set deadline on how long they'll stay, they're making memories to last a lifetime. ""We felt more homely in this tiny, little, old, two-bedroom cabin than what we did in the house [in Caboolture] that we put hours of effort and planning and hand-drew ourself,"" Ms Downs said. ""You can't stop living because of the what-ifs.""

ir89,"In their striking red scrubs, Karen and Greg BathÂ can't be missed â€” and it's a good thing too. The coupleÂ travel to many remote campdrafts, rodeos andÂ races in the outback event calendar to respond to medical emergencies. In dangerous sportsÂ like bull riding, sometimesÂ thousands of kilometres from the nearest hospital, the pairÂ play anÂ essential role inÂ keeping everyone safe. They also help ensure the events that connect isolated communities can go ahead. ""I really do enjoy it,"" Mr Bath said. ""My whole life is taking care of patients, trying to assist people."" Ms Bath, an advanced emergency medical technician,Â said their role was very important. ""We are there for the safety of people who are doing their social thing, especially in the Northern Territory, whereÂ campdrafts and these type of events is their social outlet,"" she said. ""They travel for hours and hours to meet up, and to see the kids get together with other kids. ""Importantly, weÂ watch over them to ensure that if they hurt themselves, we're there to take care of them."" Ms Bath said her work also helped her focusÂ on the here and now. SheÂ is living with a terminal breast cancer diagnosis, but caring forÂ others keepsÂ her spirits high. ""Doing what I'm doingÂ keeps me mentally sane, because I think you have to have a positive outlook, otherwiseÂ you'll just sit at home and dwell on it,"" she said. ""If you're focused on helping others, you're thinking about something outside of your own world a little bit."" She said living and travelling remotely with the disease helped her better connect with her patients' experiences of accessing health care in the bush. The medics have cared for patients with everything from sunburn toÂ spinal fractures. ""The list is endless,"" Mr Bath said. ""We get femurs fractures, we get [tibia-fibula]Â fractures, we certainly get pelvis fractures,"" he said. ""And we need to be able to treat internal injuries â€¦ a hole in the lung, spleen, liver, internal problems â€¦ all those type of things we come across on a fairly regular basis."" Mr Bath, a paramedic, said sometimes, spectators also needed assistance. ""They can present with various medical issues â€¦ cardiac events, respiratory events, and that's fairly common that we finish up with a patient that that's actually not fromÂ the event,"" he said. When they're not travelling, the duo base themselves in Queensland. But so far this season, they've been to events at Brunette Downs, Harts Range, Pussy Cat Bore, Douglas Daly, Timber Creek, Ban Ban Springs and Borroloola in the Northern Territory, as well as events in their home state. Ms BathÂ said sometimes the remote work was daunting. ""But we've been doing this for a number of years now, so we have all the equipment that we require with us,"" she said ""Our job is to keep somebody in a stable condition until we can get somebody else here to assist."" Mr BathÂ said they needed to be resourceful and capable to keep people alive. ""It's very different when you're working on a major event in a city somewhere and you've got easy access to hospital, easy access to a government ambulance system, where they can be there very quickly, maybe in ten minutes,"" he said. ""In these remote areasÂ it could take several hours to get assistance. ""We've had critical patients where it's taken up to five hours to get an aircraft in."" Though it's hard work, Ms Bath said their care was oftenÂ returned by former patients, who greeted the couple with familiar warmth. ""We got a flat tyre on the side of the road and a ute turned up with two girls in it, offering to help,"" she said. ""They said we looked after them at Tennant Creek last year.

Thomas will be demoted to the rank of entry-level private and will receive a bad-conduct discharge. The 25-year-old was among seven Marines and a Navy medic who were charged in connection with the death of Hashim Ibrahim Awad, 52.

Hutchins has pleaded not guilty to murder, conspiracy and other charges in the case. He faces a sentence of life in prison if convicted.

""He said the facts were fudged,"" Moore said, referring to Gupta, on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""That's a lie. None of the facts are fudged."" Moore and Gupta shouted and argued over data Gupta used and data Moore used. Moore said his staffers backed up the film's facts to Gupta before the report aired and that Gupta aired it knowing his facts were wrong. Gupta disputed that. Watch Moore, Gupta make their points Â» . ""We try and look for some of the best sources we can possibly find,"" he said. ""Michael has a lot of different numbers. ... You're sort of cherry-picking data from different reports."" Both agreed, however, on the basic premise of ""Sicko"": Problems abound in America's health-care system and need to be fixed. ""I thought it was a good movie, and I wanted to say that,"" Gupta said. ""I think it strikes at the irrefutable fact -- it's broken. We get it."" He praised Moore for raising awareness of the issue. However, Gupta said he was concerned that the movie -- which notes that other developed nations such as France and Canada have universal health care --suggests that health care in those countries is free. While patients may not pay for services at the doctor's office, they do pay high taxes to fund such a system, something Gupta said he was concerned that ""Sicko"" audiences might not realize. Moore responded by saying Americans pay more in copays, deductibles and insurance premiums. ""We [America] have a system built on profit,"" the moviemaker said. He asked Gupta if the current system, which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures, is cumbersome to him. ""It's a shameful system, especially when I'm dealing with some of my patients,"" Gupta said. But he questioned Moore's apparent solution -- putting health care in the hands of the Bush administration, which Moore fiercely criticized in the past, particularly in his film ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" ""The government actually used to do things right,"" Moore said in response. ""The problem is who we put in power."" Moore has adamantly opposed the war in Iraq and said the government should reprioritize -- a position he took many years before skepticism of the war's success abounded in Washington.

ir95,"""BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- None of the 1,000-plus Iraqi detainees freed in recent weeks have broken a pledge not to return to the insurgency, according to the Marine general who oversees the U.S. detention centers in Iraq. A U.S. military panel reviews a detainee's case at Camp Cropper near Baghdad. Speaking in Arabic, Maj. Gen. Doug Stone on Wednesday reassured Iraqis about how the 25,000 detainees -- mostly Sunnis -- are treated after being taken into custody on suspicion of involvement in the insurgency. Stone described the detention system as ""open and transparent,"" saying it makes the detainees better citizens and helps break the cycle of violence and poverty in the country. Stone said detainees get free medical care equal to what he gets as a general, food and water made to Islamic standards, educational opportunities, jobs skills and contact with families. The U.S. detention centers -- at Camp Bucca near the southern port city of Basra and in Camp Cropper near Baghdad -- are political sore points for Sunnis, who make up 83 percent of the detainees held. The main Sunni political coalition -- the Iraqi Accord Front -- cited the centers as one reason for quitting the government during the summer. Last month, the U.S.-led coalition launched Operation Lion's Paw in which between 50 and 70 detainees would be released daily during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan after taking a pledge not to rejoin the insurgency against the Shiite-led government. ""This pledge is an Iraqi pledge, a pledge before an Iraqi judge, frequently with a family member present,"" Stone said.

Stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond Ramadan. Stone's description seems a far cry from the Abu Ghraib prison operated by the U.S. military in the first years after the invasion. That prison was closed down and razed in the wake of an international scandal over prisoner abuse. ""There are no secrets that go on in detention,"" Stone said. ""Our facilities are open to inspection by any agency that we in the federal government believe is credible. These agencies are welcomed because they are windows for the world.""

About one-third -- or 8,000 -- are in school, with 7,000 having passed the fifth-grade level, he said. The 860 detainees who are 17 or younger are all in school, Stone said. The average stay for a detainee is 300 days, but some have been detained for two years or longer, he said. A review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security, he said. If they are deemed not to be, they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge. Only 280 detainees are foreigners, mostly from Syria, Egypt, Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, he said.

ir96,"""ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (CNN) -- The acrimony from the Republican campaign trail carried over quickly into the CNN/YouTube GOP presidential debate Wednesday. The debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month. With five weeks to go until the first contest of the 2008 nominating season, the Republican candidates engaged in a free-for-all, trying to differentiate their views on immigration, the Iraq war, abortion, gun control and even whether they believed every word in the Bible was true. Unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, Wednesday night's attacks were launched at each other. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney traded jabs over illegal immigration, something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month. Romney attacked Giuliani's record, saying that as mayor, he promoted illegal immigration. And Giuliani shot back, accusing Romney of having a ""sanctuary mansion"" at his own home. Watch the debate format produce raw moments Â» . ""In his case, there were six sanctuary cities. He did nothing about them. There was a sanctuary mansion -- at his own home, illegal immigrants were being employed,"" Giuliani said. Romney denied Giuliani's allegation, and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other. In his quest to appeal to the hard-line immigration wing of the party, Romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who has been rising in the polls. Rep. Tom Tancredo, who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration, seemed delighted with the give and take, saying the other candidates were trying to ""out-Tancredo"" him. Huckabee drew one of the night's largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was the Internal Revenue Service. ""Most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging, and there's a reason why,"" he said. Sen. John McCain, freshly back from a visit to Iraq over Thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates, and Rep. Ron Paul, the most anti-war of the candidates, tangled on two occasions over the Iraq war. Did YouTubers get their questions answered? Â» . Asked which government programs they would cut, Paul said bringing the troops home from Iraq would save ""a trillion dollars."" McCain said: ""It's that kind of isolationism that caused World War II,"" which drew some hoots from the crowd. Watch McCain, Paul spar on Iraq Â» . Paul replied: ""The real question you have to ask is why do I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel?"" A retired brigadier general, Keith Kerr, who is gay, asked candidates if they thought U.S. military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops. CNN later learned that a June media release from the campaign of Democratic front-runner Clinton listed Kerr as a member of its steering committee for gay and lesbian supporters. Watch Kerr deny that the Clinton campaign influenced his question Â» . David Bohrman, CNN senior vice president and executive producer of the debate, said, ""We regret this incident. CNN would not have used the general's question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate."" Political Ticker . Kerr told CNN after the debate that he has not worked for the Clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself. Kerr also said he is a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a national gay and lesbian Republican grass-roots organization. Prior to the debate, CNN had verified Kerr's military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate. In a section of the debate about gun ownership rights, three of the GOP presidential hopefuls said they do not own guns: McCain, Giuliani and Romney. Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson quipped, ""I own a couple of guns -- but I'm not going to tell you what they are or where they are."" Watch the candidates address gun control Â» . The debate turned personal when a viewer, holding the Bible, asked: ""Do you believe every word of this book? And I mean specifically, this book that I am holding in my hand."" Huckabee, a Baptist minister, said, ""Sure, I believe the Bible is exactly what it is."" Giuliani said he believes the Bible, but not ""literally true in every respect."" After that, Romney stammered a bit when moderator Anderson Cooper asked him if he believed every word. Watch the candidates get personal about the Bible Â» . ""Yeah, the Bible is the word of God. ... I might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word, but I read the Bible and I believe the Bible is the word of God,"" Romney said. When asked about abortion, Romney said he was wrong in favoring a woman's right to choose -- his position when he was elected governor of Massachusetts. ""If people in this country are looking for someone who's never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit they're ever wrong, they're going to have to find somebody else. On abortion, I was wrong,"" he said. His remarks came in response to the 30-second video produced for the debate by Thompson's campaign, which included a clip of Romney expressing support for Roe vs. Wade during a 1994 debate against Sen. Ted Kennedy. When asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal, Paul said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government. ""We don't need a federal abortion police, that's the last thing we need,"" Paul said. He added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities. On the issues of taxes, Thompson said he'd ""never met a tax he liked."" ""I've got a tax-cut bill on the table. But I don't do pledges to anybody but the American people,"" he said. His response was met by a ""Go, Fred, go!"" from a member of the audience. On the issue of trade with China, Rep. Duncan Hunter said China is ""cheating on trade ... and it's in the interest of the United States to stop China's cheating. Buy American this Christmas season -- that might keep your neighbor from losing his job."" The candidates fielded video questions submitted by the public via the YouTube Web site, just as Democratic White House candidates did in July. The debate was the first time the GOP candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month. CNN's political team viewed nearly 5,000 videos for the GOP debate -- about 2,000 more than they saw for the Democrats' debate.

ir97,"""WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republicans reacted with surprise and recrimination Sunday to blistering criticism of the Iraq war from former coalition commander retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez. Lawmakers lashed back at retired Gen. Ricardo Sanchez on Sunday after he criticized the war effort. On Friday, Sanchez, who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004, called the Iraq war ""a nightmare with no end in sight."" He said the Bush administration, the State Department and Congress all share blame. Speaking with military reporters in Virginia, Sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial, but the politicians have not been held accountable. ""I'm astounded, really,"" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham on CNN's ""Late Edition"" with Wolf Blitzer on Sunday. Graham, who recently returned from Baghdad, said he and GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain had visited Sanchez several times in 2003 and 2004. ""Every time we talked to Gen. Sanchez, we got pushback -- we have enough troops; Guard and reserves aren't being strained,"" Graham said. He added that Sanchez's own record in Iraq is blemished: Abu Ghraib ""got out of control under his watch. The war in general got out of control under his watch."" But Graham said that ""finally,"" with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional U.S. troops since January, ""We are getting it right."" Sanchez told reporters that American political leaders have cost American lives on the battlefield with their ""lust for power."" Sanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty, but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired. ""While the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power, our soldiers die,"" he said. That brought a tart response from McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""I wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time,"" McCain told CBS's ""Face the Nation."" He said Sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but ""unfortunately, that doesn't happen very often."" One of the reasons few speak out, he said, is evidenced by what happened to former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki, McCain said. Shinseki was sidelined after telling Congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy Iraq. Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, told ABC's ""This Week"" that Sanchez is simply wrong. ""My definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror,"" he said. ""I think we're making significant progress toward that end."" But, he added, ""I think the central government in Iraq has been an embarrassment. They've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for."" Graham said he hopes the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki will ""step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year."" If that does not happen, he said, ""it will be incumbent upon us, as a nation, to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable Iraq."" That brought a blistering response from Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under President Carter. ""What is this? This is a colony,"" he said. ""That's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter."" Even those Iraqis who were happy to see Saddam Hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing U.S. presence, Brzezinski said. Though some countries are willing to go along with the United States, ""No one in the world really supports our policy in Iraq,"" he said. In his Friday speech, Sanchez added that the ""surge"" of U.S. troops into Iraq represents ""a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war."" National Security Council spokeswoman Kate Starr did not address the comment. Instead, she said, ""We appreciate his service to the country. As Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker said, there's more work to be done but progress is being made in Iraq. And that's what we're focused on now."" Gen. David Petraeus is the U.S. top commander in Iraq.

ir98,"""LONDON, England (CNN) -- Previously unseen footage of Diana, Princess of Wales, taken just hours before she was killed in a car crash, has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death. The footage showed Diana and Dodi step into an elevator at the Ritz Hotel. Images taken from a security camera at the Ritz Hotel in Paris show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover Dodi Fayed step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel. Further footage shows Fayed visiting a jeweler's shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring. Earlier, a British coroner at the inquest said tt may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana was pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash. Lord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover Dodi Fayed that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate ""one way or the other"" whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. But he said they would hear ""intimate"" details of her personal life. Watch footage of Diana's last hours Â» . Baker told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory. On Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Diana wearing a swimsuit could not be proof she was pregnant with Dodi's child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage. The jury is set to hear ""scene setting"" evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video. The inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process. Fayed's father, Mohammed Al Fayed, has contended from the start that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family ""could not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be step-father to the future king of England,"" referring to Diana's son Prince William. ""I'm hoping for justice,"" Al Fayed said outside court. ""At last, we're going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Diana have been murdered by the royal family."" Baker told the jury of Al Fayed's allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to assign blame or guilt. ""You have to decide four important, but limited factual questions: who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their deaths,"" Baker said, according to inquest transcripts. ""The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any difficulty. The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they died."" Diana, 36, and 42-year-old Dodi Fayed were killed on August 31, 1997 when the Mercedes-Benz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris. They were being pursued at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Driver Henri Paul, who was also killed, was drunk and driving at high speed. Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was the sole survivor. Next week, the jury is scheduled to travel to Paris to see the crash site, along the River Seine. They are also expected to hear testimony from the paparazzi who were present after the accident. In its evidence section, the Web site for the inquest has posted previously unpublished pictures taken by paparazzi of the limo before and immediately after the accident. One is a closeup -- looking into the front of the vehicle -- that shows Diana, Fayed, Paul and Rees-Jones minutes before the crash.

ir99,"""DENVER, Colorado -- A Colorado man terrorized by threats after testifying against his daughter's abusive boyfriend says he has spent $10,000 on a security system, hired a bodyguard for his son's wedding and never leaves home without a .45-caliber handgun strapped to his chest. Keith Reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case. The man, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of Keith Reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family. A report in the Denver Post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of Colorado. Paul Logli, chairman of National District Attorneys Association, told Congress this year that witness intimidation has become ""almost epidemic,"" according to the Denver Post. When asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of Colorado's witness protection program, the witness in the Reynolds case said, ""All they told us was maybe we should move."" ""I'm pretty sure I told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program. I can't remember if I gave them all the details."" the prosecutor assigned to the case, who didn't want to be named, told CNN. After Reynolds' conviction, the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home. They received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked. The couple received a death threat from Reynolds himself through the mail. Watch witness describe fear of being targeted Â» . Reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation. However, it is likely he'll be released within five years. No national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist, and minimal research has been conducted on the subject. The latest National Institute of Justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem. Colorado has $50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget. In contrast, the city of Denver spent almost $100,000 on landscaping last year. The state, on average, spends about $1,000 per witness. That figure supposedly includes moving expenses, rent, and furniture. The federal program spends in excess of $40 million per year on witness protection. One possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities, as do federal witnesses. ""It's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public's expense; it's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses,"" according to Peter Weir, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety. Colorado's witness protection program is a ""joke,"" according to The Rev. Leon Kelly, founder and executive director of the Open Door Youth Gang Alternatives. Kelly says the state doesn't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward. More than a decade ago, a young man named Darryl Givens asked Kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison. Givens chose to testify. A few months later, he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends. That day continues to haunt Kelly. Rhonda Fields says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her son's murder. Javad Fields was a college graduate who was engaged to be married. He had plans to move east when a Fourth of July barbecue in 2004 in changed all that. He witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing. Javad Fields and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in Aurora, Colorado. The couple, both 22, died instantly. Rhonda Fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program. She confronted prosecutors after his murder. Fields told CNN, ""I asked them what happened. Why weren't any measures taken to safeguard his life? And I was told he never asked for any protection."" Javad's mother does not think it was her son's responsibility to ask for protection. ""I think it's the authorities' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness,"" she said. Field's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program. Prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting Javad Fields' personal information be kept secret, but it wasn't signed by a judge until one year later, after defense lawyers had already given the suspects Fields' personal information, along with crucial trial documents. ""I felt like the DA's office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life,"" Rhonda Fields told CNN. District Attorney Carol Chambers maintains the program has improved. She says a notice about witness protection is now attached to every subpoena, ensuring witnesses are aware of their options. That didn't start, however, until two years after Javad Fields was killed. E-mail to a friend .""",information retrieval,https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail
ir100,"""PARIS, France -- France lock Sebastien Chabal has been cited for a dangerous tackle on England's Simon Shaw during Saturday's World Cup semifinal in Paris. Simon Shaw offloads despite being tackled by Raphael Ibanez, left, and Sebastien Chabal. The Sale Sharks forward will face a disciplinary hearing on Monday after his tackle on opposite second-rower Shaw was noted by citing commissioner Dennis Wheelahan. Chabal started the match on the substitutes' bench, but was brought on in the 26th minute to replace the injured Fabien Pelous during hosts France's 14-9 defeat. If he is suspended, then Chabal will miss Friday's third and fourth-place play-off match at the Parc des Princes. Meanwhile, France coach Bernard Laporte said that the defeat was tougher to take than England's 24-7 win in the 2003 semifinals. ""In 2003, they were better then us. In fact they were better than everyone,"" said Laporte, who is leaving his role to take up the post of junior sports minister in the French government. ""They were like the New Zealand of this tournament - the favorite, except they went all the way. This time it's harder because yesterday it was 50-50."" Meanwhile, England -- seeking to become the first nation to defend the World Cup title -- revealed that star kicker Jonny Wilkinson again had problems with the match balls during the semifinal. The fly-half, who voiced his concerns after struggling with the boot against Australia, rejected a ball before kicking a vital three-pointer against France. ""We didn't say it last week but a non-match ball got onto the field in Marseille which Jonny kicked,"" director of rugby Rob Andrew said. ""He didn't think about it while he was kicking it. ""The match balls are marked, numbered one to six. Last night they had 'World Cup semi-final England vs France' written on them.
