sa23,"My AJAX ECO Multi-purpose Antibacterial Wipes (110 wipes) arrived on time and are in good condition. Thanks to Amazon (Au) for speedily dispatching my order and Amazon Logistics for their fast doorstep delivery.I purchased this pack of AJAX SINGLE wipes in a ""you beat"" Amazon Deal. Usually, I shop for the least expensive alternative as they are a relatively homogeneous product: they contain similar quantities of the active antibacterial ingredient. I purchased this pack in June 21 and the expiry date is in October 22.AJAX ECO wipes are significant different in that the base cloth material is manufactured from environmentally sustainable bamboo. Most other brands of antibacterial wipes use a synthetic material with potential pollution issues. AJAX wipes will compost down and add to soil fertility.AJAX wipes come in sealed plastic packs with a flip top dispenser. The seal underlying the flip top dispenser helps to keep the wipes fresh by retaining the enclosed disinfectant liquid. Before use, peel the seal away,  don't discard but reseal after each use to help maintain freshness. Also, remember to keep the dispenser top closed to further help retain freshness, when not in use. I find that frequent brief multiple daily turning (dispenser closed) of the pack assists in keeping the wipes evenly moist, particularly when numerous wipes still remain.Every AJAX ECO antibacterial wipe is for SINGLE USE ONLY and are definitely NOT FLUSHABLE (eg via the toilet). Each wipe has the approx dimensions 22.5cm × 17cm. I find that each wipe has sufficient moisture to clean and treat a dry sealed area (counter top) of approx 1.5 square metres. However, the wipes contain insufficient moisture to dissolved or loosen dried accumulated food deposits. Also, the wipes don't remove most stains (eg cordial or tea). The integrity of the cloth is maintained throughout use. There are no apparent residues or lint on surfaces after use.I use these wipes daily to clean and disinfect counter tops (kitchen and bathroom) and water taps, door handles, remote controls and mobile phones. I, also, use them for small clean-ups in the bathroom (toilet pan , cistern, seat and floor), wiping out home bins and lined cupboards.AJAX ECO wipes effectively clean and bacterially disinfect surfaces. The wipes are, also, very convenient for quick clean-ups.",sentiment analysis,https://www.amazon.com.au/product-reviews/B087C2Y1K3/ref=acr_dp_hist_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar

sa34,"Though well-written, this book seems to be more of a rather premature autobiography of a 20-something year old wealthy white male.Granted, he has overcome some first-world adversity, but I found the underlying message to be repetitive and better suited to teenagers or young adults who lack drive and direction.The underlying message, over and over (and over) is to persist with positive behaviours and they will eventually become a habit.It is well-studied that if you repeat an action 27 days in a row, it becomes a habit. That is the general crux of this book and I thought this was something most people already knew.It also appeared to me that the author has lived quite a privileged life and doesn't seem to yet understand what lifelong adversity is via lower to middle-class cards most of us are dealt in life, so if you are 30+ and have suffered many setbacks in life because you didn't win the 'family lottery', you will likely find this book mildly irritating.I personally found this book useless as I do not lack drive or ambition at all and unfortunately can't relate to a wealthy high-school jock who hurt himself playing a notoriously dangerous sport.I'll probably keep it for when my son starts reading novels.",sentiment analysis,https://www.amazon.com.au/product-reviews/1847941834/ref=acr_dpx_hist_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar

sa66,"The tags are good. Apple has one of the largest network helping to trace the items. I have attached one to my Son's school bag. I do get updates about his location but its not a continuous location tracker and may be unsuitable for tracking lost kids or pets (this is mainly due to anti stalking features). Also, it depends upon apple devices being present in the area to detect the tag. If you lose something where there is no phone coverage / apple devices, this will be of no use. The tag is not very thin (around 3 coins thick) so not suitable for placing it in men's wallet unless the wallet has a suitable cavity to accommodate it. Please consider this before buying if that's your intent. Second, there are a lot of cheap silicone keyrings available to attach these to keys and other items, however these are not reliable at all and the tag can fall out easily. You need to spend at least 20$ per tag to attach it reliably to your items. Depending upon the value, I still think this is reasonable for items such as keys and laptop backpacks, however I wish apple made the tags with a hole at least so that  it could be attached directly if needed instead of buying third party accessories. I have deducted one star for this reason.",sentiment analysis,https://www.amazon.com.au/product-reviews/B097QL9W35/ref=acr_dp_hist_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar

sa88,"Update: 1 November 20225 stars for the customer service.I’ve received the new lid however it was still leaking although not as badly as the first lid. It turns out the issue was in the bottle lip mismatching the lid, so they offered me a refund. Originally gave this a two star rating but have updated it for the great customer service. Definitely buy from this company with a peace of mind.————Update: 18 October 2022the company reached out to me and said they will send a replacement lid to fix the leaking issue. They’re pretty prompt in trying to resolve the issue and I appreciate their initiation. I will post another update when I receive the lid in working order.————I brought the 1.18L and specifically for the sippy straw lid but unfortunately it leaks no matter how tightly I twist the lid. It’s fine upright, but I won’t be able to toss it into a bag or leave it on the car seat without coming back to a puddle. The other two lids are fine though but given the 1.18L capacity, I don’t want to be tilting my wrist and bottle to drink out of it using the other two lids.
