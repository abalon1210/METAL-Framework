ir1,"Alan Joyce will leave Qantas tomorrow after a tumultuous week for the airline. Qantas announced his early departure saying Mr Joyce would bring forward his retirement by two months to help the company ""accelerate its renewal"". ""In the last few weeks, the focus on Qantas and events of the past make it clear to me that the company needs to move ahead with its renewal as a priority,"" Mr Joyce said in a statement. ""The best thing I can do under these circumstances is to bring forward my retirementÂ and hand over to Vanessa and the new management team now, knowing they will do an excellent job."" TheÂ news of Mr Joyce's abruptÂ departure comes less that a week after the competition regulator launched legal action against Qantas for allegedly selling tickets to flights that had already been cancelled over a three-month period in 2022. Qantas said it was taking those accusations seriously. The airline's current chief financial officer,Â Vanessa Hudson, will assume the role of managing director and group chief executive effective September 6, and is the first female CEO in the airline's 103-year history. She was scheduled to take over from Mr Joyce in November after being appointed in May. Mr Joyce has spent 15 years as the airline's CEO, and extended his tenure at the request of the Qantas board to assist with its recovery from the pandemic. Mr Joyce said there was a lot of he wasÂ ""proud"" of over his 22 years at Qantas, including the past 15 years as chief executive. ""There have been many ups and downs, and there is clearly much work still to be done, especially to make sure we always deliver for our customers,"" he said. ""But I leave knowing that the company is fundamentally strong and has a bright future."" Qantas chairman Richard Goyder thanked MrÂ Joyce for his service, saying his decision to bring forward his retirement showed he was putting the company first. He said Qantas now faced the task of winning back the public's confidence. ""This transition comes at what is obviously a challenging time for Qantas and its people,"" he said. ""We have an important job to do in restoring the public's confidence in the kind of company we are, and that's what the board is focused on, and what the management under Vanessa's leadership will do."" On Monday, Qantas' board of directors issued a statement in response to the ACCC action, where they apologisedÂ for falling short of expectations after the pandemic. The board also acknowledged Qantas' reputation ""has already been hit hard on several fronts"" and was taking the community's frustration and disappointment seriously. ""We know that the only way to fix it is by delivering consistently,"" the statement said. ""We know it will take time to repair. And we are absolutely determined to do that."" The national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Michael Kaine, said the news of Mr Joyce's departure from Qantas was ""the first good decision the Qantas board has made for a very long time"". Mr Kaine said Mr Joyce needs to have his millions of dollars worth of bonuses stripped ""immediately"". ""Alan Joyce is slipping into retirement two months early with a $24 million pay packet, leaving one of the biggest messes in corporate Australia's history in his wake,"" he said. ""After finally receiving the public scrutiny he deserves for trashing one of Australia's most cherished companies, Alan Joyce is exiting with a $10 million bonus, announced on Friday. ""He must be stripped of those bonuses immediately."" Had Mr Joyce stayed as Qantas CEO until November, he would have accumulatedÂ about $125 million during his time in the job.Â  It is unclear what will happen with his entitlements now he has stepped down. Mr Kaine said that in the wake of Qantas' record pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion last month, on top of $2.7 billion worth of taxpayer funding the airline received during the pandemic, and past actions of grounding of the fleet and illegal outsourcing of jobs, the company needed to refocus and chart a new path forward. ""The question now should turn to whether the board should spill their positions following years of decimated jobs and standards, illegal outsourcing, and outrageous bonuses,"" he said. ""The new regime must embark on a total reset. Qantas needs to bring back good, secure jobs and quality standards."" The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has also welcomed Mr Joyce's decision to leave the airline earlier than scheduled, and said Qantas has an opportunity to start fresh. ""Whilst we welcome Alan Joyce's exit, what really needs to go is the culture of profit over people,"" ACTU president Michele O'Neil said. ""Now is the opportunity for Qantas to restore its reputation as the nation's flagship carrier by working with unions to pay workers the fair wages and conditions they deserve and restore customers' faith in this airline."" In the past fortnight, Qantas has been involved in a number of controversies. On Monday last week,Â the airline admitted it had not disclosedÂ the true value of its unredeemed flight credits,Â during a fiery Senate committee hearing in Melbourne. Qantas had publicly said itÂ hadÂ $370 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, but senators were told during the hearingÂ that Jetstar had another $100 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, and Qantas' international passengers had more flight credits owed to them too. The airline's executives also told senators that they'd set a deadline of December 31 for millions of dollars worth of outstanding flight credits to be claimed. But after aÂ public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of thisÂ year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened."" That same morning,Â Australia's competition regulator accused Qantas of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights that the airline had already cancelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and thatÂ it soldÂ tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy. He told ABC's 7.30 that the best way for Qantas to repay the money was by earning higher profits, therefore paying more corporate tax, and the airline would pay corporate tax again in the 2025 financial year.

ir1,"Alan Joyce will leave Qantas tomorrow after a tumultuous week for the airline. Qantas announced his early departure saying Mr Joyce would bring forward his retirement by two months to help the company ""accelerate its renewal"". ""In the last few weeks, the focus on Qantas and events of the past make it clear to me that the company needs to move ahead with its renewal as a priority,"" Mr Joyce said in a statement. ""The best thing I can do under these circumstances is to bring forward my retirementÂ and hand over to Vanessa and the new management team now, knowing they will do an excellent job."" TheÂ news of Mr Joyce's abruptÂ departure comes less that a week after the competition regulator launched legal action against Qantas for allegedly selling tickets to flights that had already been cancelled over a three-month period in 2022. Qantas said it was taking those accusations seriously. The airline's current chief financial officer,Â Vanessa Hudson, will assume the role of managing director and group chief executive effective September 6, and is the first female CEO in the airline's 103-year history. She was scheduled to take over from Mr Joyce in November after being appointed in May. Mr Joyce has spent 15 years as the airline's CEO, and extended his tenure at the request of the Qantas board to assist with its recovery from the pandemic. Mr Joyce said there was a lot of he wasÂ ""proud"" of over his 22 years at Qantas, including the past 15 years as chief executive. ""There have been many ups and downs, and there is clearly much work still to be done, especially to make sure we always deliver for our customers,"" he said. ""But I leave knowing that the company is fundamentally strong and has a bright future."" Qantas chairman Richard Goyder thanked MrÂ Joyce for his service, saying his decision to bring forward his retirement showed he was putting the company first. He said Qantas now faced the task of winning back the public's confidence. ""This transition comes at what is obviously a challenging time for Qantas and its people,"" he said. ""We have an important job to do in restoring the public's confidence in the kind of company we are, and that's what the board is focused on, and what the management under Vanessa's leadership will do."" On Monday, Qantas' board of directors issued a statement in response to the ACCC action, where they apologisedÂ for falling short of expectations after the pandemic. The board also acknowledged Qantas' reputation ""has already been hit hard on several fronts"" and was taking the community's frustration and disappointment seriously. ""We know that the only way to fix it is by delivering consistently,"" the statement said. ""We know it will take time to repair. And we are absolutely determined to do that."" The national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Michael Kaine, said the news of Mr Joyce's departure from Qantas was ""the first good decision the Qantas board has made for a very long time"". Mr Kaine said Mr Joyce needs to have his millions of dollars worth of bonuses stripped ""immediately"". ""Alan Joyce is slipping into retirement two months early with a $24 million pay packet, leaving one of the biggest messes in corporate Australia's history in his wake,"" he said. ""After finally receiving the public scrutiny he deserves for trashing one of Australia's most cherished companies, Alan Joyce is exiting with a $10 million bonus, announced on Friday. ""He must be stripped of those bonuses immediately."" Had Mr Joyce stayed as Qantas CEO until November, he would have accumulatedÂ about $125 million during his time in the job.Â  It is unclear what will happen with his entitlements now he has stepped down. Mr Kaine said that in the wake of Qantas' record pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion last month, on top of $2.7 billion worth of taxpayer funding the airline received during the pandemic, and past actions of grounding of the fleet and illegal outsourcing of jobs, the company needed to refocus and chart a new path forward. ""The question now should turn to whether the board should spill their positions following years of decimated jobs and standards, illegal outsourcing, and outrageous bonuses,"" he said. ""The new regime must embark on a total reset. Qantas needs to bring back good, secure jobs and quality standards."" The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has also welcomed Mr Joyce's decision to leave the airline earlier than scheduled, and said Qantas has an opportunity to start fresh. ""Whilst we welcome Alan Joyce's exit, what really needs to go is the culture of profit over people,"" ACTU president Michele O'Neil said. ""Now is the opportunity for Qantas to restore its reputation as the nation's flagship carrier by working with unions to pay workers the fair wages and conditions they deserve and restore customers' faith in this airline."" In the past fortnight, Qantas has been involved in a number of controversies. On Monday last week,Â the airline admitted it had not disclosedÂ the true value of its unredeemed flight credits,Â during a fiery Senate committee hearing in Melbourne. Qantas had publicly said itÂ hadÂ $370 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, but senators were told during the hearingÂ that Jetstar had another $100 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, and Qantas' international passengers had more flight credits owed to them too. The airline's executives also told senators that they'd set a deadline of December 31 for millions of dollars worth of outstanding flight credits to be claimed. But after aÂ public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of thisÂ year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened."" That same morning,Â Australia's competition regulator accused Qantas of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights that the airline had already cancelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and thatÂ it soldÂ tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy. He told ABC's 7.30 that the best way for Qantas to repay the money was by earning higher profits, therefore paying more corporate tax, and the airline would pay corporate tax again in the 2025 financial year.

The national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Michael Kaine, said the news of Mr Joyce's departure from Qantas was ""the first good decision the Qantas board has made for a very long time"".

In the past fortnight, Qantas has been involved in a number of controversies. On Monday last week,Â the airline admitted it had not disclosedÂ the true value of its unredeemed flight credits,Â during a fiery Senate committee hearing in Melbourne. Qantas had publicly said itÂ hadÂ $370 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, but senators were told during the hearingÂ that Jetstar had another $100 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, and Qantas' international passengers had more flight credits owed to them too. The airline's executives also told senators that they'd set a deadline of December 31 for millions of dollars worth of outstanding flight credits to be claimed. But after aÂ public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of thisÂ year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened."" That same morning,Â Australia's competition regulator accused Qantas of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights that the airline had already cancelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and thatÂ it soldÂ tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy. He told ABC's 7.30 that the best way for Qantas to repay the money was by earning higher profits, therefore paying more corporate tax, and the airline would pay corporate tax again in the 2025 financial year.

ir1,"Alan Joyce will leave Qantas tomorrow after a tumultuous week for the airline. Qantas announced his early departure saying Mr Joyce would bring forward his retirement by two months to help the company ""accelerate its renewal"". ""In the last few weeks, the focus on Qantas and events of the past make it clear to me that the company needs to move ahead with its renewal as a priority,"" Mr Joyce said in a statement. ""The best thing I can do under these circumstances is to bring forward my retirementÂ and hand over to Vanessa and the new management team now, knowing they will do an excellent job."" TheÂ news of Mr Joyce's abruptÂ departure comes less that a week after the competition regulator launched legal action against Qantas for allegedly selling tickets to flights that had already been cancelled over a three-month period in 2022. Qantas said it was taking those accusations seriously. The airline's current chief financial officer,Â Vanessa Hudson, will assume the role of managing director and group chief executive effective September 6, and is the first female CEO in the airline's 103-year history. She was scheduled to take over from Mr Joyce in November after being appointed in May. Mr Joyce has spent 15 years as the airline's CEO, and extended his tenure at the request of the Qantas board to assist with its recovery from the pandemic. Mr Joyce said there was a lot of he wasÂ ""proud"" of over his 22 years at Qantas, including the past 15 years as chief executive. ""There have been many ups and downs, and there is clearly much work still to be done, especially to make sure we always deliver for our customers,"" he said. ""But I leave knowing that the company is fundamentally strong and has a bright future."" Qantas chairman Richard Goyder thanked MrÂ Joyce for his service, saying his decision to bring forward his retirement showed he was putting the company first. He said Qantas now faced the task of winning back the public's confidence. ""This transition comes at what is obviously a challenging time for Qantas and its people,"" he said. ""We have an important job to do in restoring the public's confidence in the kind of company we are, and that's what the board is focused on, and what the management under Vanessa's leadership will do."" On Monday, Qantas' board of directors issued a statement in response to the ACCC action, where they apologisedÂ for falling short of expectations after the pandemic. The board also acknowledged Qantas' reputation ""has already been hit hard on several fronts"" and was taking the community's frustration and disappointment seriously. ""We know that the only way to fix it is by delivering consistently,"" the statement said. ""We know it will take time to repair. And we are absolutely determined to do that."" The national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Michael Kaine, said the news of Mr Joyce's departure from Qantas was ""the first good decision the Qantas board has made for a very long time"". Mr Kaine said Mr Joyce needs to have his millions of dollars worth of bonuses stripped ""immediately"". ""Alan Joyce is slipping into retirement two months early with a $24 million pay packet, leaving one of the biggest messes in corporate Australia's history in his wake,"" he said. ""After finally receiving the public scrutiny he deserves for trashing one of Australia's most cherished companies, Alan Joyce is exiting with a $10 million bonus, announced on Friday. ""He must be stripped of those bonuses immediately."" Had Mr Joyce stayed as Qantas CEO until November, he would have accumulatedÂ about $125 million during his time in the job.Â  It is unclear what will happen with his entitlements now he has stepped down. Mr Kaine said that in the wake of Qantas' record pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion last month, on top of $2.7 billion worth of taxpayer funding the airline received during the pandemic, and past actions of grounding of the fleet and illegal outsourcing of jobs, the company needed to refocus and chart a new path forward. ""The question now should turn to whether the board should spill their positions following years of decimated jobs and standards, illegal outsourcing, and outrageous bonuses,"" he said. ""The new regime must embark on a total reset. Qantas needs to bring back good, secure jobs and quality standards."" The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has also welcomed Mr Joyce's decision to leave the airline earlier than scheduled, and said Qantas has an opportunity to start fresh. ""Whilst we welcome Alan Joyce's exit, what really needs to go is the culture of profit over people,"" ACTU president Michele O'Neil said. ""Now is the opportunity for Qantas to restore its reputation as the nation's flagship carrier by working with unions to pay workers the fair wages and conditions they deserve and restore customers' faith in this airline."" In the past fortnight, Qantas has been involved in a number of controversies. On Monday last week,Â the airline admitted it had not disclosedÂ the true value of its unredeemed flight credits,Â during a fiery Senate committee hearing in Melbourne. Qantas had publicly said itÂ hadÂ $370 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, but senators were told during the hearingÂ that Jetstar had another $100 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, and Qantas' international passengers had more flight credits owed to them too. The airline's executives also told senators that they'd set a deadline of December 31 for millions of dollars worth of outstanding flight credits to be claimed. But after aÂ public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of thisÂ year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened."" That same morning,Â Australia's competition regulator accused Qantas of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights that the airline had already cancelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and thatÂ it soldÂ tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy. He told ABC's 7.30 that the best way for Qantas to repay the money was by earning higher profits, therefore paying more corporate tax, and the airline would pay corporate tax again in the 2025 financial year.

Mr Joyce has spent 15 years as the airline's CEO, and extended his tenure at the request of the Qantas board to assist with its recovery from the pandemic. Mr Joyce said there was a lot of he wasÂ ""proud"" of over his 22 years at Qantas, including the past 15 years as chief executive. ""There have been many ups and downs, and there is clearly much work still to be done, especially to make sure we always deliver for our customers,"" he said. ""But I leave knowing that the company is fundamentally strong and has a bright future."" Qantas chairman Richard Goyder thanked MrÂ Joyce for his service, saying his decision to bring forward his retirement showed he was putting the company first. He said Qantas now faced the task of winning back the public's confidence. ""This transition comes at what is obviously a challenging time for Qantas and its people,"" he said. ""We have an important job to do in restoring the public's confidence in the kind of company we are, and that's what the board is focused on, and what the management under Vanessa's leadership will do."" On Monday, Qantas' board of directors issued a statement in response to the ACCC action, where they apologisedÂ for falling short of expectations after the pandemic. The board also acknowledged Qantas' reputation ""has already been hit hard on several fronts"" and was taking the community's frustration and disappointment seriously. ""We know that the only way to fix it is by delivering consistently,"" the statement said. ""We know it will take time to repair. And we are absolutely determined to do that."" The national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Michael Kaine, said the news of Mr Joyce's departure from Qantas was ""the first good decision the Qantas board has made for a very long time"". Mr Kaine said Mr Joyce needs to have his millions of dollars worth of bonuses stripped ""immediately"". ""Alan Joyce is slipping into retirement two months early with a $24 million pay packet, leaving one of the biggest messes in corporate Australia's history in his wake,"" he said. ""After finally receiving the public scrutiny he deserves for trashing one of Australia's most cherished companies, Alan Joyce is exiting with a $10 million bonus, announced on Friday. ""He must be stripped of those bonuses immediately."" Had Mr Joyce stayed as Qantas CEO until November, he would have accumulatedÂ about $125 million during his time in the job.Â  It is unclear what will happen with his entitlements now he has stepped down. Mr Kaine said that in the wake of Qantas' record pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion last month, on top of $2.7 billion worth of taxpayer funding the airline received during the pandemic, and past actions of grounding of the fleet and illegal outsourcing of jobs, the company needed to refocus and chart a new path forward. ""The question now should turn to whether the board should spill their positions following years of decimated jobs and standards, illegal outsourcing, and outrageous bonuses,"" he said. ""The new regime must embark on a total reset. Qantas needs to bring back good, secure jobs and quality standards."" The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has also welcomed Mr Joyce's decision to leave the airline earlier than scheduled, and said Qantas has an opportunity to start fresh. ""Whilst we welcome Alan Joyce's exit, what really needs to go is the culture of profit over people,"" ACTU president Michele O'Neil said. ""Now is the opportunity for Qantas to restore its reputation as the nation's flagship carrier by working with unions to pay workers the fair wages and conditions they deserve and restore customers' faith in this airline."" In the past fortnight, Qantas has been involved in a number of controversies. On Monday last week,Â the airline admitted it had not disclosedÂ the true value of its unredeemed flight credits,Â during a fiery Senate committee hearing in Melbourne. Qantas had publicly said itÂ hadÂ $370 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, but senators were told during the hearingÂ that Jetstar had another $100 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, and Qantas' international passengers had more flight credits owed to them too. The airline's executives also told senators that they'd set a deadline of December 31 for millions of dollars worth of outstanding flight credits to be claimed. But after aÂ public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of thisÂ year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened."" That same morning,Â Australia's competition regulator accused Qantas of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights that the airline had already cancelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and thatÂ it soldÂ tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy. He told ABC's 7.30 that the best way for Qantas to repay the money was by earning higher profits, therefore paying more corporate tax, and the airline would pay corporate tax again in the 2025 financial year.

ir2,"The three brothers who own Whakaari White Island have had charges against them dismissed in an Auckland court. James, Andrew and Peter Buttle were charged under New Zealandâ€™s workplace health and safety laws with failing to adequately understand and manage the risks of allowing tours on the island. Worksafe NZ argued the brothers, as directors of their company Whakaari Management Limited (WML), failed to ensure an expert risk assessment was conducted prior to the December 2019 eruption, which killed 22 people, including 17 Australians. Their defence lawyerÂ James CairneyÂ argued the prosecution had not done enough to prove the charge against each individual. Judge Evangelos Thomas agreed, saying: ""There is no evidence in this case as to what happened behind the boardroom door at WML. Without that evidence I cannot assess what a reasonable director would have done."" Worksafe NZ concluded its prosecution last week, before the Buttles lodged an application to have charges against the individual brothers dismissed. Today, that application was granted. While charges against the individuals have been dismissed, the trial over their company WML's involvement continues. Thirteen parties were charged as part of this case, including the three Buttle brothers, their company WML, the tour operator White Island Tours, several other tourism companies as well as New Zealand's volcano monitor GNS Science and National Emergency Management Agency. The Buttles and WML pleaded not guilty, as did two other tourism companiesÂ â€” ID Tours NZ and Tauranga Tourism Services â€” that are also on trial.Â  The court is due to hear applications from ID Tours NZ and Tauranga Tourism Services to have charges against them dismissed tomorrow.Â  Five other parties, including tour operators, have pleaded guilty and are yet to be sentenced.Â The National Emergency Management Agency pleaded not guilty before applying to have charges against it dismissed and was successful.Â  The Buttle brothers' lawyer Mr Cairney has repeatedly argued throughout his cross-examination of prosecution witnessesÂ that the duty under the workplace health and safety act does not fall to the owners of the land, but the operators of the tours.Â  He said he was not conceding his clients had a duty under the act, but even if they did, the prosecution had not provided evidence they failed in that duty, nor had they provided evidence on the circumstances of the brothers' individualÂ roles as directors of WML. ""They are not a group, this is not a prosecution of a family,"" Mr Cairney told the court last week. ""This is three individual prosecutions of three named defendants."" Worksafe NZ opposed the application to have the charges dismissed. Lawyer Michael Hodge said last week while the court would need to consider the evidence against each defendant separately, there was ""significant overlap in respect of the allegations and evidence against each Buttle"". He said whether or not there were assigned roles within WML, all three brothers, as directors of the company, had a duty to ensure the risk assessment was done.Â  ""If they tasked someone else to do it, or they tasked one of the three to do it, fine, but at the end of the day, all three were responsible for ensuring that it was done,"" Mr Hodge told the court. He said the evidence presented to the court showed that had not happened.Â List the top 10 information from this text.",Introducing Typos,"Theothrqe brobhewskwhobown phabyaji chito txlqnd havewyaj rhewges agrinst thyq dismissee in an tbckllnd courx.

ir2,"The three brothers who own Whakaari White Island have had charges against them dismissed in an Auckland court. James, Andrew and Peter Buttle were charged under New Zealandâ€™s workplace health and safety laws with failing to adequately understand and manage the risks of allowing tours on the island.

Their defence lawyerÂ James CairneyÂ argued the prosecution had not done enough to prove the charge against each individual. Judge Evangelos Thomas agreed, saying: ""There is no evidence in this case as to what happened behind the boardroom door at WML. Without that evidence I cannot assess what a reasonable director would have done."" Worksafe NZ concluded its prosecution last week, before the Buttles lodged an application to have charges against the individual brothers dismissed. Today, that application was granted. While charges against the individuals have been dismissed, the trial over their company WML's involvement continues. Thirteen parties were charged as part of this case, including the three Buttle brothers, their company WML, the tour operator White Island Tours, several other tourism companies as well as New Zealand's volcano monitor GNS Science and National Emergency Management Agency.

ir4,"Belated it may be but Alan Joyce's fall from grace is something to behold.Â  For 15 years, he has courted power and cultivated influence, becomingÂ one of the highest-paid executives in the land, all as Qantas operations have suffered and its reputation has been trashed. Suddenly, the never-ending spin that often ran counter to reality and truth has unravelled, leaving the diminutive corporate pugilist alone and increasingly isolated. Rather than a fond farewell, Joyce is facing an ignominious end. Qantas has hit the ejector button without a parachute before his scheduled November departure. It is a course of action the board had to consider. For as events in recent years at National Australia Bank, Westpac and Rio Tinto have shown, directors slow to act end up being shown the door themselves. Qantas is now fighting court action on three fronts:Â from his workforce, his customers and a federal government agency. The only group backing him are investors, who have been on the receiving end of a vast flood of cash, courtesy of ultra-high airfares and taxpayer funds. But even they are growing nervous. Hailed by some in the business community for taking on the unions, it is worth remembering the airline's actions have been declared illegal in court, a decision endorsed on appeal. Not one to shrink from a fight, Qantas now has taken the matter of its illegal sackings to the HighÂ Court. Then there is a class action from thousands of irate consumers, stunned by what they claim is the airline's strategy to appropriate more than half a billion dollars from cancelled flights and book it as profit. That rapidly spreading incendiary was given an almighty leg up late last week by the competition regulator which launched its own legal action, accusing Qantas of selling tickets on more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled, some of them up to 47 days earlier. If successful, and the evidence appears compelling, Qantas could be up for huge fines. It was the aeronautical equivalent of revelations from the banking royal commission, where some of our biggest financial institutions were caught selling life insurance to dead people. The stench had already begun to spread. Rather than take control of the situation, immediately remove Joyce from the company and suspend any further payments to him, the Qantas board, led by Richard Goyder, stood firmly behind its embattled chief executive even as the situation deteriorated. And deteriorate it did. In a startling turn of events, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also revealed that Qantas had concealed the number of flight cancellations to federal government authorities since it relaunched. Rather than the 4,149 cancellations it had owned up to, there were in fact almost three times that number, with the ACCC discovering more than 15,000. Disturbingly, it appears Qantas executives were being paid bonuses linked to diminishing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even jolt the normally lethargic corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, into action. But amidÂ all the scandal, backflips, controversy, apologies and admissions the airline's reputation had been ""tarnished"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to dish out more than $10 million in bonuses to Joyce. For years, Joyce has proclaimed that he didn't take any bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were confined to the tarmac and workers in their tens of thousands were laid off. That's true, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed scrapped. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""retention payment"" which was pretty much the same as his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses weren't scrapped at all. Instead, they were deferred, pushed back into a later time frame. Which is now. This was all done with board approval. As was Joyce's recent decision to sell $17 million worth of Qantas shares at a time he knew the ACCC was investigating its flight credit debacle. The pain now is rippling through the ranks of investors. After the debacle a decade ago, when Joyce shut down Qantas in a showdown with the airline's unions, and a follow-up disaster two years later when the carrier lost $2.8 billion trying to beat Virgin into submission, he reasoned that while you can alienate your customers and staff without too many repercussions, it's never wise to upset the owners. But there are limits. Shareholders have been happy to take the cash that has been rolled back to them via share buybacks and, right now, are on the receiving end of another $500 million buyback. That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Buybacks not only are tax effective but they have the added attraction of pushing up the share price. If you are an executive with a bonus based on share-price performance, it's an even sweeter deal. Not only are your accumulated share allocations worth even more, you'll be entitled to more shares for hitting your targets. Ordinarily, with Qantas standing in the market holding a $500 million buy order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards the heavens. But the daily avalanche of awful news accompanied by convoluted explanations, conflicting statements and ongoing concealmentsÂ has seen investors head for the exits. Despite the buyback announced less than a fortnight ago, Qantas shares have been in freefall, down 15 per cent in the past week, plunging to theirÂ lowest level in almost a year. In a company that hasn't managed to break even during his 15-year stint in the boss's seat, Alan Joyce has done a remarkable job on the executive pay scale. It's unclear what will happen with his entitlements now that he's stepped down. If he had made it until November, and he kept all his entitlements, he was set to end up accumulating about $125 million for himself.Â Â  But what will he leave behind? The ACCC's court action, if successful, could incur fines north of $250 million. Westpac paid a $920 million fine over breaching money-laundering laws, and CBA was forced to shell out $700 million for failing to meet transaction disclosure requirements. Courts and regulators these days aren't prepared to tolerate corporate malfeasance. Then there is the bill for replacing the ageing fleet, now one of the oldest of all major airlines after Joyce continually delayed the purchase of new jets. With a potential $15 billion price tag, that is going to drain Qantas' cash flow for years to come. Joyce's hand-picked successor, Vanessa Hudson, may well have been delivered the ultimate hospital pass. But the biggest cost of all could be the loss of respect and influence in Canberra.

ir4,"Belated it may be but Alan Joyce's fall from grace is something to behold.Â  For 15 years, he has courted power and cultivated influence, becomingÂ one of the highest-paid executives in the land, all as Qantas operations have suffered and its reputation has been trashed. Suddenly, the never-ending spin that often ran counter to reality and truth has unravelled, leaving the diminutive corporate pugilist alone and increasingly isolated. Rather than a fond farewell, Joyce is facing an ignominious end. Qantas has hit the ejector button without a parachute before his scheduled November departure. It is a course of action the board had to consider. For as events in recent years at National Australia Bank, Westpac and Rio Tinto have shown, directors slow to act end up being shown the door themselves. Qantas is now fighting court action on three fronts:Â from his workforce, his customers and a federal government agency. The only group backing him are investors, who have been on the receiving end of a vast flood of cash, courtesy of ultra-high airfares and taxpayer funds. But even they are growing nervous. Hailed by some in the business community for taking on the unions, it is worth remembering the airline's actions have been declared illegal in court, a decision endorsed on appeal. Not one to shrink from a fight, Qantas now has taken the matter of its illegal sackings to the HighÂ Court. Then there is a class action from thousands of irate consumers, stunned by what they claim is the airline's strategy to appropriate more than half a billion dollars from cancelled flights and book it as profit. That rapidly spreading incendiary was given an almighty leg up late last week by the competition regulator which launched its own legal action, accusing Qantas of selling tickets on more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled, some of them up to 47 days earlier. If successful, and the evidence appears compelling, Qantas could be up for huge fines. It was the aeronautical equivalent of revelations from the banking royal commission, where some of our biggest financial institutions were caught selling life insurance to dead people. The stench had already begun to spread. Rather than take control of the situation, immediately remove Joyce from the company and suspend any further payments to him, the Qantas board, led by Richard Goyder, stood firmly behind its embattled chief executive even as the situation deteriorated. And deteriorate it did. In a startling turn of events, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also revealed that Qantas had concealed the number of flight cancellations to federal government authorities since it relaunched. Rather than the 4,149 cancellations it had owned up to, there were in fact almost three times that number, with the ACCC discovering more than 15,000. Disturbingly, it appears Qantas executives were being paid bonuses linked to diminishing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even jolt the normally lethargic corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, into action. But amidÂ all the scandal, backflips, controversy, apologies and admissions the airline's reputation had been ""tarnished"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to dish out more than $10 million in bonuses to Joyce. For years, Joyce has proclaimed that he didn't take any bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were confined to the tarmac and workers in their tens of thousands were laid off. That's true, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed scrapped. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""retention payment"" which was pretty much the same as his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses weren't scrapped at all. Instead, they were deferred, pushed back into a later time frame. Which is now. This was all done with board approval. As was Joyce's recent decision to sell $17 million worth of Qantas shares at a time he knew the ACCC was investigating its flight credit debacle. The pain now is rippling through the ranks of investors. After the debacle a decade ago, when Joyce shut down Qantas in a showdown with the airline's unions, and a follow-up disaster two years later when the carrier lost $2.8 billion trying to beat Virgin into submission, he reasoned that while you can alienate your customers and staff without too many repercussions, it's never wise to upset the owners. But there are limits. Shareholders have been happy to take the cash that has been rolled back to them via share buybacks and, right now, are on the receiving end of another $500 million buyback. That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Buybacks not only are tax effective but they have the added attraction of pushing up the share price. If you are an executive with a bonus based on share-price performance, it's an even sweeter deal. Not only are your accumulated share allocations worth even more, you'll be entitled to more shares for hitting your targets. Ordinarily, with Qantas standing in the market holding a $500 million buy order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards the heavens. But the daily avalanche of awful news accompanied by convoluted explanations, conflicting statements and ongoing concealmentsÂ has seen investors head for the exits. Despite the buyback announced less than a fortnight ago, Qantas shares have been in freefall, down 15 per cent in the past week, plunging to theirÂ lowest level in almost a year. In a company that hasn't managed to break even during his 15-year stint in the boss's seat, Alan Joyce has done a remarkable job on the executive pay scale. It's unclear what will happen with his entitlements now that he's stepped down. If he had made it until November, and he kept all his entitlements, he was set to end up accumulating about $125 million for himself.Â Â  But what will he leave behind? The ACCC's court action, if successful, could incur fines north of $250 million. Westpac paid a $920 million fine over breaching money-laundering laws, and CBA was forced to shell out $700 million for failing to meet transaction disclosure requirements. Courts and regulators these days aren't prepared to tolerate corporate malfeasance. Then there is the bill for replacing the ageing fleet, now one of the oldest of all major airlines after Joyce continually delayed the purchase of new jets. With a potential $15 billion price tag, that is going to drain Qantas' cash flow for years to come. Joyce's hand-picked successor, Vanessa Hudson, may well have been delivered the ultimate hospital pass. But the biggest cost of all could be the loss of respect and influence in Canberra. The Morrison government forked out $2.7 billion in taxpayer cash to Qantas with no strings attached. Half of that has been pumped straight back to shareholders, including the executives. And now the Albanese government is under fire for its cosy relationship with Qantas after it admitted it blocked Qatar Airways from running extra flights just so it could protect the airline in a deal that screws over consumers and pushes up inflation. The Flying Kangaroo has always punched well above its weight when it comes to lobbying. Almost every pollie in the nation sports a Chairman's Lounge ticket which, incidentally, are selected personally by Joyce.

But there are limits. Shareholders have been happy to take the cash that has been rolled back to them via share buybacks and, right now, are on the receiving end of another $500 million buyback. That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Buybacks not only are tax effective but they have the added attraction of pushing up the share price. If you are an executive with a bonus based on share-price performance, it's an even sweeter deal. Not only are your accumulated share allocations worth even more, you'll be entitled to more shares for hitting your targets. Ordinarily, with Qantas standing in the market holding a $500 million buy order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards the heavens. But the daily avalanche of awful news accompanied by convoluted explanations, conflicting statements and ongoing concealmentsÂ has seen investors head for the exits. Despite the buyback announced less than a fortnight ago, Qantas shares have been in freefall, down 15 per cent in the past week, plunging to theirÂ lowest level in almost a year. In a company that hasn't managed to break even during his 15-year stint in the boss's seat, Alan Joyce has done a remarkable job on the executive pay scale. It's unclear what will happen with his entitlements now that he's stepped down. If he had made it until November, and he kept all his entitlements, he was set to end up accumulating about $125 million for himself.Â Â  But what will he leave behind? The ACCC's court action, if successful, could incur fines north of $250 million. Westpac paid a $920 million fine over breaching money-laundering laws, and CBA was forced to shell out $700 million for failing to meet transaction disclosure requirements. Courts and regulators these days aren't prepared to tolerate corporate malfeasance. Then there is the bill for replacing the ageing fleet, now one of the oldest of all major airlines after Joyce continually delayed the purchase of new jets. With a potential $15 billion price tag, that is going to drain Qantas' cash flow for years to come. Joyce's hand-picked successor, Vanessa Hudson, may well have been delivered the ultimate hospital pass. But the biggest cost of all could be the loss of respect and influence in Canberra. The Morrison government forked out $2.7 billion in taxpayer cash to Qantas with no strings attached. Half of that has been pumped straight back to shareholders, including the executives. And now the Albanese government is under fire for its cosy relationship with Qantas after it admitted it blocked Qatar Airways from running extra flights just so it could protect the airline in a deal that screws over consumers and pushes up inflation. The Flying Kangaroo has always punched well above its weight when it comes to lobbying. Almost every pollie in the nation sports a Chairman's Lounge ticket which, incidentally, are selected personally by Joyce.

For 4s events in recent years at N4t10n4l Australia Bank, W3stp4c and R10 Tinto have sh0wn, directors slow t0 act end up b31ng shown the d00r themselves. Qantas 1s now fighting c0urt action 0n thr33 fronts:Â from his w0rkf0rc3, his cust0m3rs 4nd a f3d3r4l government agency. The only group backing him are investors, wh0 h4v3 b33n on th3 receiving end of 4 v4st flood of cash, courtesy 0f ultra-high 41rf4r3s and t4xp4y3r funds. But even they are gr0w1ng nervous.

In 4 startling turn 0f 3v3nts, the 4ustr4l14n Competition and Consumer Commission also r3v34l3d th4t Qantas had concealed th3 numb3r 0f flight cancellations to federal government authorities since 1t relaunched. R4th3r th4n the 4,149 c4nc3ll4t10ns it had 0wn3d up to, there were in f4ct almost thr33 times that numb3r, with th3 4CCC d1sc0v3r1ng m0r3 than 15,000. Disturbingly, 1t 4pp34rs Qantas executives were b31ng paid b0nus3s l1nk3d to diminishing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events th4t should 3v3n jolt th3 normally lethargic corporate r3gul4t0r, th3 4ustr4l14n Securities 4nd Investments Commission, into action. But amidÂ all th3 sc4nd4l, backflips, controversy, 4p0l0g13s and admissions the airline's reputation h4d been ""tarnished"", Q4nt4s's board l4st week proceeded w1th 1ts pl4n t0 dish out m0r3 th4n $10 m1ll10n 1n b0nus3s to Joyce. For y34rs, J0yc3 has proclaimed that he d1dn't take any bonuses dur1ng the p4nd3m1c when 41rl1n3s gl0b4lly were confined to the tarmac 4nd w0rk3rs 1n their tens 0f th0us4nds were laid off. That's true, kind 0f. His short-term bonus was 1nd33d scr4pp3d. But it was replaced by what th3 company c4ll3d 4 ""retention payment"" wh1ch was pr3tty much th3 s4m3 as his short-term bonus. The l0ng-t3rm bonuses w3r3n't scr4pp3d at all. Instead, th3y w3r3 d3f3rr3d, pushed b4ck into a later time frame. Wh1ch is now. Th1s was all d0n3 with b04rd approval. As was Joyce's r3c3nt d3c1s10n to sell $17 m1ll10n worth of Qantas sh4r3s at a time he kn3w th3 ACCC was investigating 1ts flight credit d3b4cl3. The p41n now is rippling through the r4nks of 1nv3st0rs. 4ft3r th3 debacle 4 decade 4g0, when J0yc3 shut down Q4nt4s in 4 showdown with the airline's unions, and a f0ll0w-up d1s4st3r two y34rs later when the carrier l0st $2.8 billion trying to b34t Virgin into subm1ss10n, he r34s0n3d th4t while you can alienate your cust0m3rs and st4ff w1th0ut too m4ny repercussions, it's never wise to ups3t the owners. But th3r3 are l1m1ts. Sh4r3h0ld3rs h4v3 been h4ppy t0 t4k3 the cash th4t has been rolled back t0 them via sh4r3 buyb4cks and, right now, 4r3 on the receiving end 0f another $500 million buyback. That t4k3s the total to $1.5 billion 1n th3 past y34r. Buybacks not only 4r3 tax 3ff3ct1v3 but they have the added attraction of push1ng up the sh4r3 price. 1f you 4r3 4n executive with 4 b0nus based on sh4r3-pr1c3 performance, 1t's 4n even sweeter d34l. N0t 0nly are your accumulated sh4r3 allocations w0rth even more, y0u'll be 3nt1tl3d t0 more shares for hitting y0ur t4rg3ts. Ordinarily, w1th Qantas st4nd1ng 1n th3 market holding 4 $500 million buy order for its own shares, th3 st0ck w0uld be heading t0w4rds the heavens. But th3 daily avalanche of 4wful news 4cc0mp4n13d by convoluted 3xpl4n4t10ns, c0nfl1ct1ng statements and ongoing concealmentsÂ has seen 1nv3st0rs head f0r th3 exits.

In a company th4t h4sn't m4n4g3d to break even during his 15-y34r stint in th3 b0ss's seat, Alan Joyce has done a remarkable j0b on the executive p4y scale. It's unclear what will happen with h1s 3nt1tl3m3nts now that he's st3pp3d down. 1f he had made it unt1l N0v3mb3r, and he k3pt all his entitlements, h3 w4s set t0 3nd up 4ccumul4t1ng 4b0ut $125 m1ll10n f0r himself.Â Â But wh4t will he leave b3h1nd?

ir4,"Belated it may be but Alan Joyce's fall from grace is something to behold.Â  For 15 years, he has courted power and cultivated influence, becomingÂ one of the highest-paid executives in the land, all as Qantas operations have suffered and its reputation has been trashed. Suddenly, the never-ending spin that often ran counter to reality and truth has unravelled, leaving the diminutive corporate pugilist alone and increasingly isolated. Rather than a fond farewell, Joyce is facing an ignominious end. Qantas has hit the ejector button without a parachute before his scheduled November departure. It is a course of action the board had to consider. For as events in recent years at National Australia Bank, Westpac and Rio Tinto have shown, directors slow to act end up being shown the door themselves. Qantas is now fighting court action on three fronts:Â from his workforce, his customers and a federal government agency. The only group backing him are investors, who have been on the receiving end of a vast flood of cash, courtesy of ultra-high airfares and taxpayer funds. But even they are growing nervous. Hailed by some in the business community for taking on the unions, it is worth remembering the airline's actions have been declared illegal in court, a decision endorsed on appeal. Not one to shrink from a fight, Qantas now has taken the matter of its illegal sackings to the HighÂ Court. Then there is a class action from thousands of irate consumers, stunned by what they claim is the airline's strategy to appropriate more than half a billion dollars from cancelled flights and book it as profit. That rapidly spreading incendiary was given an almighty leg up late last week by the competition regulator which launched its own legal action, accusing Qantas of selling tickets on more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled, some of them up to 47 days earlier. If successful, and the evidence appears compelling, Qantas could be up for huge fines. It was the aeronautical equivalent of revelations from the banking royal commission, where some of our biggest financial institutions were caught selling life insurance to dead people. The stench had already begun to spread. Rather than take control of the situation, immediately remove Joyce from the company and suspend any further payments to him, the Qantas board, led by Richard Goyder, stood firmly behind its embattled chief executive even as the situation deteriorated. And deteriorate it did. In a startling turn of events, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also revealed that Qantas had concealed the number of flight cancellations to federal government authorities since it relaunched. Rather than the 4,149 cancellations it had owned up to, there were in fact almost three times that number, with the ACCC discovering more than 15,000. Disturbingly, it appears Qantas executives were being paid bonuses linked to diminishing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even jolt the normally lethargic corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, into action. But amidÂ all the scandal, backflips, controversy, apologies and admissions the airline's reputation had been ""tarnished"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to dish out more than $10 million in bonuses to Joyce. For years, Joyce has proclaimed that he didn't take any bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were confined to the tarmac and workers in their tens of thousands were laid off. That's true, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed scrapped. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""retention payment"" which was pretty much the same as his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses weren't scrapped at all. Instead, they were deferred, pushed back into a later time frame. Which is now. This was all done with board approval. As was Joyce's recent decision to sell $17 million worth of Qantas shares at a time he knew the ACCC was investigating its flight credit debacle. The pain now is rippling through the ranks of investors. After the debacle a decade ago, when Joyce shut down Qantas in a showdown with the airline's unions, and a follow-up disaster two years later when the carrier lost $2.8 billion trying to beat Virgin into submission, he reasoned that while you can alienate your customers and staff without too many repercussions, it's never wise to upset the owners. But there are limits. Shareholders have been happy to take the cash that has been rolled back to them via share buybacks and, right now, are on the receiving end of another $500 million buyback. That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Buybacks not only are tax effective but they have the added attraction of pushing up the share price. If you are an executive with a bonus based on share-price performance, it's an even sweeter deal. Not only are your accumulated share allocations worth even more, you'll be entitled to more shares for hitting your targets. Ordinarily, with Qantas standing in the market holding a $500 million buy order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards the heavens. But the daily avalanche of awful news accompanied by convoluted explanations, conflicting statements and ongoing concealmentsÂ has seen investors head for the exits. Despite the buyback announced less than a fortnight ago, Qantas shares have been in freefall, down 15 per cent in the past week, plunging to theirÂ lowest level in almost a year. In a company that hasn't managed to break even during his 15-year stint in the boss's seat, Alan Joyce has done a remarkable job on the executive pay scale. It's unclear what will happen with his entitlements now that he's stepped down. If he had made it until November, and he kept all his entitlements, he was set to end up accumulating about $125 million for himself.Â Â  But what will he leave behind? The ACCC's court action, if successful, could incur fines north of $250 million. Westpac paid a $920 million fine over breaching money-laundering laws, and CBA was forced to shell out $700 million for failing to meet transaction disclosure requirements. Courts and regulators these days aren't prepared to tolerate corporate malfeasance. Then there is the bill for replacing the ageing fleet, now one of the oldest of all major airlines after Joyce continually delayed the purchase of new jets. With a potential $15 billion price tag, that is going to drain Qantas' cash flow for years to come. Joyce's hand-picked successor, Vanessa Hudson, may well have been delivered the ultimate hospital pass. But the biggest cost of all could be the loss of respect and influence in Canberra. The Morrison government forked out $2.7 billion in taxpayer cash to Qantas with no strings attached. Half of that has been pumped straight back to shareholders, including the executives. And now the Albanese government is under fire for its cosy relationship with Qantas after it admitted it blocked Qatar Airways from running extra flights just so it could protect the airline in a deal that screws over consumers and pushes up inflation. The Flying Kangaroo has always punched well above its weight when it comes to lobbying. Almost every pollie in the nation sports a Chairman's Lounge ticket which, incidentally, are selected personally by Joyce.

ir4,"Belated it may be but Alan Joyce's fall from grace is something to behold.Â  For 15 years, he has courted power and cultivated influence, becomingÂ one of the highest-paid executives in the land, all as Qantas operations have suffered and its reputation has been trashed. Suddenly, the never-ending spin that often ran counter to reality and truth has unravelled, leaving the diminutive corporate pugilist alone and increasingly isolated. Rather than a fond farewell, Joyce is facing an ignominious end. Qantas has hit the ejector button without a parachute before his scheduled November departure. It is a course of action the board had to consider. For as events in recent years at National Australia Bank, Westpac and Rio Tinto have shown, directors slow to act end up being shown the door themselves. Qantas is now fighting court action on three fronts:Â from his workforce, his customers and a federal government agency. The only group backing him are investors, who have been on the receiving end of a vast flood of cash, courtesy of ultra-high airfares and taxpayer funds. But even they are growing nervous. Hailed by some in the business community for taking on the unions, it is worth remembering the airline's actions have been declared illegal in court, a decision endorsed on appeal. Not one to shrink from a fight, Qantas now has taken the matter of its illegal sackings to the HighÂ Court. Then there is a class action from thousands of irate consumers, stunned by what they claim is the airline's strategy to appropriate more than half a billion dollars from cancelled flights and book it as profit. That rapidly spreading incendiary was given an almighty leg up late last week by the competition regulator which launched its own legal action, accusing Qantas of selling tickets on more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled, some of them up to 47 days earlier. If successful, and the evidence appears compelling, Qantas could be up for huge fines. It was the aeronautical equivalent of revelations from the banking royal commission, where some of our biggest financial institutions were caught selling life insurance to dead people. The stench had already begun to spread. Rather than take control of the situation, immediately remove Joyce from the company and suspend any further payments to him, the Qantas board, led by Richard Goyder, stood firmly behind its embattled chief executive even as the situation deteriorated. And deteriorate it did. In a startling turn of events, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also revealed that Qantas had concealed the number of flight cancellations to federal government authorities since it relaunched. Rather than the 4,149 cancellations it had owned up to, there were in fact almost three times that number, with the ACCC discovering more than 15,000. Disturbingly, it appears Qantas executives were being paid bonuses linked to diminishing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even jolt the normally lethargic corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, into action. But amidÂ all the scandal, backflips, controversy, apologies and admissions the airline's reputation had been ""tarnished"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to dish out more than $10 million in bonuses to Joyce. For years, Joyce has proclaimed that he didn't take any bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were confined to the tarmac and workers in their tens of thousands were laid off. That's true, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed scrapped. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""retention payment"" which was pretty much the same as his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses weren't scrapped at all. Instead, they were deferred, pushed back into a later time frame. Which is now. This was all done with board approval. As was Joyce's recent decision to sell $17 million worth of Qantas shares at a time he knew the ACCC was investigating its flight credit debacle. The pain now is rippling through the ranks of investors. After the debacle a decade ago, when Joyce shut down Qantas in a showdown with the airline's unions, and a follow-up disaster two years later when the carrier lost $2.8 billion trying to beat Virgin into submission, he reasoned that while you can alienate your customers and staff without too many repercussions, it's never wise to upset the owners. But there are limits. Shareholders have been happy to take the cash that has been rolled back to them via share buybacks and, right now, are on the receiving end of another $500 million buyback. That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Buybacks not only are tax effective but they have the added attraction of pushing up the share price. If you are an executive with a bonus based on share-price performance, it's an even sweeter deal. Not only are your accumulated share allocations worth even more, you'll be entitled to more shares for hitting your targets. Ordinarily, with Qantas standing in the market holding a $500 million buy order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards the heavens. But the daily avalanche of awful news accompanied by convoluted explanations, conflicting statements and ongoing concealmentsÂ has seen investors head for the exits. Despite the buyback announced less than a fortnight ago, Qantas shares have been in freefall, down 15 per cent in the past week, plunging to theirÂ lowest level in almost a year. In a company that hasn't managed to break even during his 15-year stint in the boss's seat, Alan Joyce has done a remarkable job on the executive pay scale. It's unclear what will happen with his entitlements now that he's stepped down. If he had made it until November, and he kept all his entitlements, he was set to end up accumulating about $125 million for himself.Â Â  But what will he leave behind? The ACCC's court action, if successful, could incur fines north of $250 million. Westpac paid a $920 million fine over breaching money-laundering laws, and CBA was forced to shell out $700 million for failing to meet transaction disclosure requirements. Courts and regulators these days aren't prepared to tolerate corporate malfeasance. Then there is the bill for replacing the ageing fleet, now one of the oldest of all major airlines after Joyce continually delayed the purchase of new jets. With a potential $15 billion price tag, that is going to drain Qantas' cash flow for years to come. Joyce's hand-picked successor, Vanessa Hudson, may well have been delivered the ultimate hospital pass. But the biggest cost of all could be the loss of respect and influence in Canberra. The Morrison government forked out $2.7 billion in taxpayer cash to Qantas with no strings attached. Half of that has been pumped straight back to shareholders, including the executives. And now the Albanese government is under fire for its cosy relationship with Qantas after it admitted it blocked Qatar Airways from running extra flights just so it could protect the airline in a deal that screws over consumers and pushes up inflation. The Flying Kangaroo has always punched well above its weight when it comes to lobbying. Almost every pollie in the nation sports a Chairman's Lounge ticket which, incidentally, are selected personally by Joyce. That suddenly is looking less like a badge of honour and more like an item of scorn. If you're unable to load the form, click here.

But the daily alnhvaace of aufwl news accompanied by convoluted explanations, cfnciinlotg stteeanmts and oonigng ccaonltsnemeÂ has seen ivontress head for the exist. Despite the buyback announced less tahn a frniohtgt ago, Qantas shares have been in freefall, down 15 per cnet in the past week, plngnuig to thireÂ leowst level in almost a year. In a company that hasn't managed to break even dirung his 15-year stint in the boss's stea, Alan Jyoce has done a remarkable job on the executive pay scale. It's unclear what will haeppn with his entitlements now taht he's speetpd down. If he had made it unitl November, and he kept all his eettmnstenli, he was set to end up accumulating about $125 million for himself.Â Â But waht will he leave behind? The ACCC's court action, if successful, could incur fines north of $250 million. Westpac piad a $920 million fine over bhircaeng money-laundering laws, and CBA was forced to shell out $700 mllioin for failing to meet transaction dlcsosuire requirements. Courts and regulators tehse days aren't prepared to tolerate corporate malfeasance. Tehn there is the blil for raniepclg the aegnig fleet, now one of the oldest of all major airlines after Joyce continually delayed the prschuae of new jets. With a potential $15 billion price tag, that is going to drain Qantas' cash folw for years to cemo. Joyce's hand-picked sescrscuo, Vanessa Hudson, may well have been delivered the ulamttie hospital psas. But the biggest cost of all cluod be the lsos of respect and iunlfence in Canberra. The Moorrsin government forked out $2.7 billion in taxpayer cash to Qnatas wtih no snrtigs atehdtac. Half of that has been pumped straight back to slarsdohereh, including the executives. And now the Aabesnle government is udenr fire for its csoy rnlieohsaitp with Qaatns after it admitted it blocked Qtaar Airways from running exrta fhiltgs just so it could protect the airline in a deal that screws oevr consumers and pushes up inflation. The Flying Kangaroo has always pcnehud well above its weight when it comes to lobbying. Almost eevry pollie in the nation sports a Canhma'irs Lounge ticket which, icaditynelnl, are selected personally by Joyec. That suddenly is looking less like a badge of huoonr and more like an item of scorn. If you're unable to load the form, click here. List the top 10 information from this text.","1.

ir5,"A breakthrough in the cold case murder of a man in central Queensland almost 15 years ago has detectives hopeful the ""offenders can be brought to justice"", as his son appeals for help to find his father's killer. Francis Patrick Foley was last seen at Rubyvale, west of Rockhampton in the Gemfields areaÂ in December 2008, and was the caretaker of aÂ non-commissioned lease of remote fossicking land. Neighbours reported hearing gunshots around the time of his disappearance, but previous searches by police in 2010 did not yield any clues. Human remains located by a fossicker in July, 2022 at Sheep Station Creek â€” around 1 kilometre from Mr Foley's residence â€” have since been linked to his close-living relatives through DNA testing, and police will conduct a forensic search at the site today. ""We do believe that with public assistance, irrespective of the passage of time, this crime can be solved, offenders can be brought to justice and we can provide some closure to Frank's family and friends,""Â Detective Senior Sergeant Tara Kentwell said. A $500,000 reward for information that leads to the apprehension and conviction of those responsible for Mr Foley's murder has been offered by the Queensland government. Detective Senior SergeantÂ KentwellÂ saidÂ Mr Foley was last seen on December 23, 2008, when he travelled to Emerald with a neighbour to do some Christmas shopping, before returning home. He was reported missing five days later, when a neighbour went to check on him after localised flooding and foundÂ an exploded gas bottle and Mr Foley's discarded wallet in the carport. ""Blood located at the scene was later identified as belonging to Frank,"" said Ms Kentwell, adding that damage to the gas bottle and Mr Foley's home wereÂ ""consistent with having been hit by a gunshot blast"". ""Neighbours recall hearing gunshots in the direction of Frank's residence during the afternoon and into the evening of the 23rd or the 24th of December, 2008.""
