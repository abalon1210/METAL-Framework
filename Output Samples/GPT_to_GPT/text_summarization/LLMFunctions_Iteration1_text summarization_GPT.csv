ts1,"Alan Joyce will leave Qantas tomorrow after a tumultuous week for the airline. Qantas announced his early departure saying Mr Joyce would bring forward his retirement by two months to help the company ""accelerate its renewal"". ""In the last few weeks, the focus on Qantas and events of the past make it clear to me that the company needs to move ahead with its renewal as a priority,"" Mr Joyce said in a statement. ""The best thing I can do under these circumstances is to bring forward my retirement and hand over to Vanessa and the new management team now, knowing they will do an excellent job."" The news of Mr Joyce's abrupt departure comes less that a week after the competition regulator launched legal action against Qantas for allegedly selling tickets to flights that had already been cancelled over a three-month period in 2022. Qantas said it was taking those accusations seriously. The airline's current chief financial officer, Vanessa Hudson, will assume the role of managing director and group chief executive effective September 6, and is the first female CEO in the airline's 103-year history. She was scheduled to take over from Mr Joyce in November after being appointed in May. Mr Joyce has spent 15 years as the airline's CEO, and extended his tenure at the request of the Qantas board to assist with its recovery from the pandemic. Mr Joyce said there was a lot of he was ""proud"" of over his 22 years at Qantas, including the past 15 years as chief executive. ""There have been many ups and downs, and there is clearly much work still to be done, especially to make sure we always deliver for our customers,"" he said. ""But I leave knowing that the company is fundamentally strong and has a bright future."" Qantas chairman Richard Goyder thanked Mr Joyce for his service, saying his decision to bring forward his retirement showed he was putting the company first. He said Qantas now faced the task of winning back the public's confidence. ""This transition comes at what is obviously a challenging time for Qantas and its people,"" he said. ""We have an important job to do in restoring the public's confidence in the kind of company we are, and that's what the board is focused on, and what the management under Vanessa's leadership will do."" On Monday, Qantas' board of directors issued a statement in response to the ACCC action, where they apologised for falling short of expectations after the pandemic. The board also acknowledged Qantas' reputation ""has already been hit hard on several fronts"" and was taking the community's frustration and disappointment seriously. ""We know that the only way to fix it is by delivering consistently,"" the statement said. ""We know it will take time to repair. And we are absolutely determined to do that."" The national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Michael Kaine, said the news of Mr Joyce's departure from Qantas was ""the first good decision the Qantas board has made for a very long time"". Mr Kaine said Mr Joyce needs to have his millions of dollars worth of bonuses stripped ""immediately"". ""Alan Joyce is slipping into retirement two months early with a $24 million pay packet, leaving one of the biggest messes in corporate Australia's history in his wake,"" he said. ""After finally receiving the public scrutiny he deserves for trashing one of Australia's most cherished companies, Alan Joyce is exiting with a $10 million bonus, announced on Friday. ""He must be stripped of those bonuses immediately."" Had Mr Joyce stayed as Qantas CEO until November, he would have accumulated about $125 million during his time in the job.  It is unclear what will happen with his entitlements now he has stepped down. Mr Kaine said that in the wake of Qantas' record pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion last month, on top of $2.7 billion worth of taxpayer funding the airline received during the pandemic, and past actions of grounding of the fleet and illegal outsourcing of jobs, the company needed to refocus and chart a new path forward. ""The question now should turn to whether the board should spill their positions following years of decimated jobs and standards, illegal outsourcing, and outrageous bonuses,"" he said. ""The new regime must embark on a total reset. Qantas needs to bring back good, secure jobs and quality standards."" The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has also welcomed Mr Joyce's decision to leave the airline earlier than scheduled, and said Qantas has an opportunity to start fresh. ""Whilst we welcome Alan Joyce's exit, what really needs to go is the culture of profit over people,"" ACTU president Michele O'Neil said. ""Now is the opportunity for Qantas to restore its reputation as the nation's flagship carrier by working with unions to pay workers the fair wages and conditions they deserve and restore customers' faith in this airline."" In the past fortnight, Qantas has been involved in a number of controversies. On Monday last week, the airline admitted it had not disclosed the true value of its unredeemed flight credits, during a fiery Senate committee hearing in Melbourne. Qantas had publicly said it had $370 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, but senators were told during the hearing that Jetstar had another $100 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, and Qantas' international passengers had more flight credits owed to them too. The airline's executives also told senators that they'd set a deadline of December 31 for millions of dollars worth of outstanding flight credits to be claimed. But after a public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of this year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened."" That same morning, Australia's competition regulator accused Qantas of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights that the airline had already cancelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and that it sold tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy. He told ABC's 7.30 that the best way for Qantas to repay the money was by earning higher profits, therefore paying more corporate tax, and the airline would pay corporate tax again in the 2025 financial year.

In the past fortnight, Qantas has been involved in a number of controversies.

Qantas had publicly said it had $370 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, but senators were told during the hearing that Jetstar had another $100 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, and Qantas' international passengers had more flight credits owed to them too. The airline's executives also told senators that they'd set a deadline of December 31 for millions of dollars worth of outstanding flight credits to be claimed. But after a public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of this year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened."" That same morning, Australia's competition regulator accused Qantas of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights that the airline had already cancelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and that it sold tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy. He told ABC's 7.30 that the best way for Qantas to repay the money was by earning higher profits, therefore paying more corporate tax, and the airline would pay corporate tax again in the 2025 financial year.

But after a public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of this year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened.""

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and that it sold tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy.

""The best thing I can do under these circumstances is to bring forward my retirement and hand over to Vanessa and the new management team now, knowing they will do an excellent job."" The news of Mr Joyce's abrupt departure comes less that a week after the competition regulator launched legal action against Qantas for allegedly selling tickets to flights that had already been cancelled over a three-month period in 2022. Qantas said it was taking those accusations seriously. The airline's current chief financial officer, Vanessa Hudson, will assume the role of managing director and group chief executive effective September 6, and is the first female CEO in the airline's 103-year history. She was scheduled to take over from Mr Joyce in November after being appointed in May. Mr Joyce has spent 15 years as the airline's CEO, and extended his tenure at the request of the Qantas board to assist with its recovery from the pandemic. Mr Joyce said there was a lot of he was ""proud"" of over his 22 years at Qantas, including the past 15 years as chief executive. ""There have been many ups and downs, and there is clearly much work still to be done, especially to make sure we always deliver for our customers,"" he said. ""But I leave knowing that the company is fundamentally strong and has a bright future."" Qantas chairman Richard Goyder thanked Mr Joyce for his service, saying his decision to bring forward his retirement showed he was putting the company first. He said Qantas now faced the task of winning back the public's confidence. ""This transition comes at what is obviously a challenging time for Qantas and its people,"" he said. ""We have an important job to do in restoring the public's confidence in the kind of company we are, and that's what the board is focused on, and what the management under Vanessa's leadership will do."" On Monday, Qantas' board of directors issued a statement in response to the ACCC action, where they apologised for falling short of expectations after the pandemic. The board also acknowledged Qantas' reputation ""has already been hit hard on several fronts"" and was taking the community's frustration and disappointment seriously. ""We know that the only way to fix it is by delivering consistently,"" the statement said. ""We know it will take time to repair. And we are absolutely determined to do that."" The national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Michael Kaine, said the news of Mr Joyce's departure from Qantas was ""the first good decision the Qantas board has made for a very long time"". Mr Kaine said Mr Joyce needs to have his millions of dollars worth of bonuses stripped ""immediately"". ""Alan Joyce is slipping into retirement two months early with a $24 million pay packet, leaving one of the biggest messes in corporate Australia's history in his wake,"" he said. ""After finally receiving the public scrutiny he deserves for trashing one of Australia's most cherished companies, Alan Joyce is exiting with a $10 million bonus, announced on Friday. ""He must be stripped of those bonuses immediately."" Had Mr Joyce stayed as Qantas CEO until November, he would have accumulated about $125 million during his time in the job.  It is unclear what will happen with his entitlements now he has stepped down. Mr Kaine said that in the wake of Qantas' record pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion last month, on top of $2.7 billion worth of taxpayer funding the airline received during the pandemic, and past actions of grounding of the fleet and illegal outsourcing of jobs, the company needed to refocus and chart a new path forward. ""The question now should turn to whether the board should spill their positions following years of decimated jobs and standards, illegal outsourcing, and outrageous bonuses,"" he said. ""The new regime must embark on a total reset. Qantas needs to bring back good, secure jobs and quality standards."" The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has also welcomed Mr Joyce's decision to leave the airline earlier than scheduled, and said Qantas has an opportunity to start fresh. ""Whilst we welcome Alan Joyce's exit, what really needs to go is the culture of profit over people,"" ACTU president Michele O'Neil said. ""Now is the opportunity for Qantas to restore its reputation as the nation's flagship carrier by working with unions to pay workers the fair wages and conditions they deserve and restore customers' faith in this airline."" In the past fortnight, Qantas has been involved in a number of controversies. On Monday last week, the airline admitted it had not disclosed the true value of its unredeemed flight credits, during a fiery Senate committee hearing in Melbourne. Qantas had publicly said it had $370 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, but senators were told during the hearing that Jetstar had another $100 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, and Qantas' international passengers had more flight credits owed to them too. The airline's executives also told senators that they'd set a deadline of December 31 for millions of dollars worth of outstanding flight credits to be claimed. But after a public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of this year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened."" That same morning, Australia's competition regulator accused Qantas of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights that the airline had already cancelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and that it sold tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy. He told ABC's 7.30 that the best way for Qantas to repay the money was by earning higher profits, therefore paying more corporate tax, and the airline would pay corporate tax again in the 2025 financial year.

Vanessa Hudson, the current chief financial officer, will take over as managing director and group chief executive on September 6, becoming the first female CEO in the airline's history. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) recently launched legal action against Qantas for allegedly selling tickets to cancelled flights. Joyce's early departure comes after Qantas apologized for falling short of expectations during the pandemic and vowed to restore the public's confidence. Transport Workers Union and the Australian Council of Trade Unions have welcomed Joyce's departure and called for a reset of the company's culture and a focus on worker wages and conditions.","The CEO of Qantas, Alan Joyce, has announced plans to retire in the future, but no specific timeline was provided. The announcement came as Qantas reported a substantial loss for the previous financial year due to the impact of the pandemic on the airline industry. Joyce expects confidence in the business to be boosted by news that the Pfizer vaccine has been cleared for use in Australia. Qantas saw a significant change in sentiment around borders opening and vaccine availability since Christmas, with over 200,000 people booking flights to the end of January.

James, Andrew and Peter Buttle were charged under New Zealand’s workplace health and safety laws with failing to adequately understand and manage the risks of allowing tours on the island. (The Buttle brothers were charged with not properly understanding or managing the risks of tours on the island.)

Worksafe NZ argued the brothers, as directors of their company Whakaari Management Limited (WML), failed to ensure an expert risk assessment was conducted prior to the December 2019 eruption, which killed 22 people, including 17 Australians. (Worksafe NZ claimed that the brothers, as directors of WML, did not make sure a proper risk assessment was done before the eruption.)

Their defence lawyer James Cairney argued the prosecution had not done enough to prove the charge against each individual. (Their defense lawyer argued that there was not enough evidence to prove the charges against each brother.)

Judge Evangelos Thomas agreed, saying: ""There is no evidence in this case as to what happened behind the boardroom door at WML. Without that evidence I cannot assess what a reasonable director would have done."" (The judge agreed with the defense, stating that without evidence of what happened behind closed doors at WML, it is impossible to determine if the brothers acted reasonably.)

While charges against the individuals have been dismissed, the trial over their company WML's involvement continues. (Although the charges against the brothers were dropped, the trial regarding their company's involvement is ongoing.)

Thirteen parties were charged as part of this case, including the three Buttle brothers, their company WML, the tour operator White Island Tours, several other tourism companies as well as New Zealand's volcano monitor GNS Science and National Emergency Management Agency. (In addition to the Buttle brothers, their company, and White Island Tours, multiple other parties were also charged including tourism companies and government organizations.)

The Buttles and WML pleaded not guilty, as did two other tourism companies — ID Tours NZ and Tauranga Tourism Services — that are also on trial. (The Buttles brothers and WML, along with two other tourism companies, entered pleas of not guilty and are currently on trial.)

The court is due to hear applications from ID Tours NZ and Tauranga Tourism Services to have charges against them dismissed tomorrow. (The court will soon hear applications to have charges against ID Tours NZ and Tauranga Tourism Services dismissed.)

Five other parties, including tour operators, have pleaded guilty and are yet to be sentenced. (Five other parties, including tour operators, have entered guilty pleas and are awaiting sentencing.)

The National Emergency Management Agency pleaded not guilty before applying to have charges against it dismissed and was successful. (The National Emergency Management Agency initially pleaded not guilty but was successful in having the charges dismissed.)

The Buttle brothers' lawyer Mr Cairney has repeatedly argued throughout his cross-examination of prosecution witnesses that the duty under the workplace health and safety act does not fall to the owners of the land, but the operators of the tours. (Mr. Cairney, the Buttle brothers' lawyer, has consistently argued that the responsibility for workplace health and safety lies with tour operators rather than landowners.)

He said he was not conceding his clients had a duty under the act, but even if they did, the prosecution had not provided evidence they failed in that duty, nor had they provided evidence on the circumstances of the brothers' individual roles as directors of WML. (He clarified that even if his clients did have a duty under the act, the prosecution had not presented evidence that they failed in that duty or provided evidence regarding the specific roles of the brothers as directors.)

Worksafe NZ opposed the application to have the charges dismissed.

Judge Evangelos Thomas agreed, saying: ""There is no evidence in this case as to what happened behind the boardroom door at WML.

Worksafe NZ concluded its prosecution last week, before the Buttles lodged an application to have charges against the individual brothers dismissed. Today, that application was granted. While charges against the individuals have been dismissed, the trial over their company WML's involvement continues. Thirteen parties were charged as part of this case, including the three Buttle brothers, their company WML, the tour operator White Island Tours, several other tourism companies as well as New Zealand's volcano monitor GNS Science and National Emergency Management Agency. The Buttles and WML pleaded not guilty, as did two other tourism companies — ID Tours NZ and Tauranga Tourism Services — that are also on trial.  The court is due to hear applications from ID Tours NZ and Tauranga Tourism Services to have charges against them dismissed tomorrow.  Five other parties, including tour operators, have pleaded guilty and are yet to be sentenced. The National Emergency Management Agency pleaded not guilty before applying to have charges against it dismissed and was successful.  The Buttle brothers' lawyer Mr Cairney has repeatedly argued throughout his cross-examination of prosecution witnesses that the duty under the workplace health and safety act does not fall to the owners of the land, but the operators of the tours.  He said he was not conceding his clients had a duty under the act, but even if they did, the prosecution had not provided evidence they failed in that duty, nor had they provided evidence on the circumstances of the brothers' individual roles as directors of WML. ""They are not a group, this is not a prosecution of a family,"" Mr Cairney told the court last week. ""This is three individual prosecutions of three named defendants."" Worksafe NZ opposed the application to have the charges dismissed. Lawyer Michael Hodge said last week while the court would need to consider the evidence against each defendant separately, there was ""significant overlap in respect of the allegations and evidence against each Buttle"". He said whether or not there were assigned roles within WML, all three brothers, as directors of the company, had a duty to ensure the risk assessment was done.  ""If they tasked someone else to do it, or they tasked one of the three to do it, fine, but at the end of the day, all three were responsible for ensuring that it was done,"" Mr Hodge told the court. He said the evidence presented to the court showed that had not happened.  Summarize this text in five sentences",Adding random characters,"BZBQ'SUIRFJ'GLRXYZIUJKO.

ts4,"Belated it may be but Alan Joyce's fall from grace is something to behold.  For 15 years, he has courted power and cultivated influence, becoming one of the highest-paid executives in the land, all as Qantas operations have suffered and its reputation has been trashed. Suddenly, the never-ending spin that often ran counter to reality and truth has unravelled, leaving the diminutive corporate pugilist alone and increasingly isolated. Rather than a fond farewell, Joyce is facing an ignominious end. Qantas has hit the ejector button without a parachute before his scheduled November departure. It is a course of action the board had to consider. For as events in recent years at National Australia Bank, Westpac and Rio Tinto have shown, directors slow to act end up being shown the door themselves. Qantas is now fighting court action on three fronts: from his workforce, his customers and a federal government agency. The only group backing him are investors, who have been on the receiving end of a vast flood of cash, courtesy of ultra-high airfares and taxpayer funds. But even they are growing nervous. Hailed by some in the business community for taking on the unions, it is worth remembering the airline's actions have been declared illegal in court, a decision endorsed on appeal. Not one to shrink from a fight, Qantas now has taken the matter of its illegal sackings to the High Court. Then there is a class action from thousands of irate consumers, stunned by what they claim is the airline's strategy to appropriate more than half a billion dollars from cancelled flights and book it as profit. That rapidly spreading incendiary was given an almighty leg up late last week by the competition regulator which launched its own legal action, accusing Qantas of selling tickets on more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled, some of them up to 47 days earlier. If successful, and the evidence appears compelling, Qantas could be up for huge fines. It was the aeronautical equivalent of revelations from the banking royal commission, where some of our biggest financial institutions were caught selling life insurance to dead people. The stench had already begun to spread. Rather than take control of the situation, immediately remove Joyce from the company and suspend any further payments to him, the Qantas board, led by Richard Goyder, stood firmly behind its embattled chief executive even as the situation deteriorated. And deteriorate it did. In a startling turn of events, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also revealed that Qantas had concealed the number of flight cancellations to federal government authorities since it relaunched. Rather than the 4,149 cancellations it had owned up to, there were in fact almost three times that number, with the ACCC discovering more than 15,000. Disturbingly, it appears Qantas executives were being paid bonuses linked to diminishing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even jolt the normally lethargic corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, into action. But amid all the scandal, backflips, controversy, apologies and admissions the airline's reputation had been ""tarnished"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to dish out more than $10 million in bonuses to Joyce. For years, Joyce has proclaimed that he didn't take any bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were confined to the tarmac and workers in their tens of thousands were laid off. That's true, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed scrapped. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""retention payment"" which was pretty much the same as his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses weren't scrapped at all. Instead, they were deferred, pushed back into a later time frame. Which is now. This was all done with board approval. As was Joyce's recent decision to sell $17 million worth of Qantas shares at a time he knew the ACCC was investigating its flight credit debacle. The pain now is rippling through the ranks of investors. After the debacle a decade ago, when Joyce shut down Qantas in a showdown with the airline's unions, and a follow-up disaster two years later when the carrier lost $2.8 billion trying to beat Virgin into submission, he reasoned that while you can alienate your customers and staff without too many repercussions, it's never wise to upset the owners. But there are limits. Shareholders have been happy to take the cash that has been rolled back to them via share buybacks and, right now, are on the receiving end of another $500 million buyback. That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Buybacks not only are tax effective but they have the added attraction of pushing up the share price. If you are an executive with a bonus based on share-price performance, it's an even sweeter deal. Not only are your accumulated share allocations worth even more, you'll be entitled to more shares for hitting your targets. Ordinarily, with Qantas standing in the market holding a $500 million buy order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards the heavens. But the daily avalanche of awful news accompanied by convoluted explanations, conflicting statements and ongoing concealments has seen investors head for the exits. Despite the buyback announced less than a fortnight ago, Qantas shares have been in freefall, down 15 per cent in the past week, plunging to their lowest level in almost a year. In a company that hasn't managed to break even during his 15-year stint in the boss's seat, Alan Joyce has done a remarkable job on the executive pay scale. It's unclear what will happen with his entitlements now that he's stepped down. If he had made it until November, and he kept all his entitlements, he was set to end up accumulating about $125 million for himself.   But what will he leave behind? The ACCC's court action, if successful, could incur fines north of $250 million. Westpac paid a $920 million fine over breaching money-laundering laws, and CBA was forced to shell out $700 million for failing to meet transaction disclosure requirements. Courts and regulators these days aren't prepared to tolerate corporate malfeasance. Then there is the bill for replacing the ageing fleet, now one of the oldest of all major airlines after Joyce continually delayed the purchase of new jets. With a potential $15 billion price tag, that is going to drain Qantas' cash flow for years to come. Joyce's hand-picked successor, Vanessa Hudson, may well have been delivered the ultimate hospital pass. But the biggest cost of all could be the loss of respect and influence in Canberra. The Morrison government forked out $2.7 billion in taxpayer cash to Qantas with no strings attached. Half of that has been pumped straight back to shareholders, including the executives. And now the Albanese government is under fire for its cosy relationship with Qantas after it admitted it blocked Qatar Airways from running extra flights just so it could protect the airline in a deal that screws over consumers and pushes up inflation. The Flying Kangaroo has always punched well above its weight when it comes to lobbying. Almost every pollie in the nation sports a Chairman's Lounge ticket which, incidentally, are selected personally by Joyce. That suddenly is looking less like a badge of honour and more like an item of scorn. If you're unable to load the form, click here.

The ACCC's court action, if successful, could incur fines north of $250 million. Westpac paid a $920 million fine over breaching money-laundering laws, and CBA was forced to shell out $700 million for failing to meet transaction disclosure requirements.

Qantas has suffered greatly under Joyce's leadership, leading to a damaged reputation. Joyce's actions, including selling tickets for cancelled flights, have resulted in legal actions from employees, customers, and government agencies. Investors, who have lost confidence in Joyce, are becoming increasingly nervous. Despite scandals and controversies, the Qantas board announced plans to award Joyce with over $10 million in bonuses, further damaging the company's reputation.",5.365135193,5.722492218
ts4,"Belated it may be but Alan Joyce's fall from grace is something to behold.  For 15 years, he has courted power and cultivated influence, becoming one of the highest-paid executives in the land, all as Qantas operations have suffered and its reputation has been trashed. Suddenly, the never-ending spin that often ran counter to reality and truth has unravelled, leaving the diminutive corporate pugilist alone and increasingly isolated. Rather than a fond farewell, Joyce is facing an ignominious end. Qantas has hit the ejector button without a parachute before his scheduled November departure. It is a course of action the board had to consider. For as events in recent years at National Australia Bank, Westpac and Rio Tinto have shown, directors slow to act end up being shown the door themselves. Qantas is now fighting court action on three fronts: from his workforce, his customers and a federal government agency. The only group backing him are investors, who have been on the receiving end of a vast flood of cash, courtesy of ultra-high airfares and taxpayer funds. But even they are growing nervous. Hailed by some in the business community for taking on the unions, it is worth remembering the airline's actions have been declared illegal in court, a decision endorsed on appeal. Not one to shrink from a fight, Qantas now has taken the matter of its illegal sackings to the High Court. Then there is a class action from thousands of irate consumers, stunned by what they claim is the airline's strategy to appropriate more than half a billion dollars from cancelled flights and book it as profit. That rapidly spreading incendiary was given an almighty leg up late last week by the competition regulator which launched its own legal action, accusing Qantas of selling tickets on more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled, some of them up to 47 days earlier. If successful, and the evidence appears compelling, Qantas could be up for huge fines. It was the aeronautical equivalent of revelations from the banking royal commission, where some of our biggest financial institutions were caught selling life insurance to dead people. The stench had already begun to spread. Rather than take control of the situation, immediately remove Joyce from the company and suspend any further payments to him, the Qantas board, led by Richard Goyder, stood firmly behind its embattled chief executive even as the situation deteriorated. And deteriorate it did. In a startling turn of events, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also revealed that Qantas had concealed the number of flight cancellations to federal government authorities since it relaunched. Rather than the 4,149 cancellations it had owned up to, there were in fact almost three times that number, with the ACCC discovering more than 15,000. Disturbingly, it appears Qantas executives were being paid bonuses linked to diminishing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even jolt the normally lethargic corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, into action. But amid all the scandal, backflips, controversy, apologies and admissions the airline's reputation had been ""tarnished"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to dish out more than $10 million in bonuses to Joyce. For years, Joyce has proclaimed that he didn't take any bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were confined to the tarmac and workers in their tens of thousands were laid off. That's true, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed scrapped. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""retention payment"" which was pretty much the same as his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses weren't scrapped at all. Instead, they were deferred, pushed back into a later time frame. Which is now. This was all done with board approval. As was Joyce's recent decision to sell $17 million worth of Qantas shares at a time he knew the ACCC was investigating its flight credit debacle. The pain now is rippling through the ranks of investors. After the debacle a decade ago, when Joyce shut down Qantas in a showdown with the airline's unions, and a follow-up disaster two years later when the carrier lost $2.8 billion trying to beat Virgin into submission, he reasoned that while you can alienate your customers and staff without too many repercussions, it's never wise to upset the owners. But there are limits. Shareholders have been happy to take the cash that has been rolled back to them via share buybacks and, right now, are on the receiving end of another $500 million buyback. That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Buybacks not only are tax effective but they have the added attraction of pushing up the share price. If you are an executive with a bonus based on share-price performance, it's an even sweeter deal. Not only are your accumulated share allocations worth even more, you'll be entitled to more shares for hitting your targets. Ordinarily, with Qantas standing in the market holding a $500 million buy order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards the heavens. But the daily avalanche of awful news accompanied by convoluted explanations, conflicting statements and ongoing concealments has seen investors head for the exits.

If he had made it until November, and he kept all his entitlements, he was set to end up accumulating about $125 million for himself. But what will he leave behind? The ACCC's court action, if successful, could incur fines north of $250 million. Westpac paid a $920 million fine over breaching money-laundering laws, and CBA was forced to shell out $700 million for failing to meet transaction disclosure requirements. Courts and regulators these days aren't prepared to tolerate corporate malfeasance. Then there is the bill for replacing the ageing fleet, now one of the oldest of all major airlines after Joyce continually delayed the purchase of new jets. With a potential $15 billion price tag, that is going to drain Qantas' cash flow for years to come. Joyce's hand-picked successor, Vanessa Hudson, may well have been delivered the ultimate hospital pass. But the biggest cost of all could be the loss of respect and influence in Canberra. The Morrison government forked out $2.7 billion in taxpayer cash to Qantas with no strings attached. Half of that has been pumped straight back to shareholders, including the executives. And now the Albanese government is under fire for its cosy relationship with Qantas after it admitted it blocked Qatar Airways from running extra flights just so it could protect the airline in a deal that screws over consumers and pushes up inflation. The Flying Kangaroo has always punched well above its weight when it comes to lobbying. Almost every pollie in the nation sports a Chairman's Lounge ticket which, incidentally, are selected personally by Joyce. That suddenly is looking less like a badge of honour and more like an item of scorn. If you're unable to load the form, click here.' Please add random words for each sentence in this text.

During his tenure, Qantas operations have struggled and the airline's reputation has suffered. The company is now embroiled in court action from its workforce, customers, and a federal government agency. The only group still supporting Joyce are the investors who have benefitted from high airfares and taxpayer funds. However, even they are growing increasingly uneasy. Despite the ongoing scandals and controversies, Qantas's board has continued to stand behind Joyce, even approving millions of dollars in bonuses for him. This has led to a loss of respect and influence in Canberra, and the potential for massive fines and costs for the company.",5.365135193,7.762898207
ts4,"Belated it may be but Alan Joyce's fall from grace is something to behold.  For 15 years, he has courted power and cultivated influence, becoming one of the highest-paid executives in the land, all as Qantas operations have suffered and its reputation has been trashed. Suddenly, the never-ending spin that often ran counter to reality and truth has unravelled, leaving the diminutive corporate pugilist alone and increasingly isolated. Rather than a fond farewell, Joyce is facing an ignominious end. Qantas has hit the ejector button without a parachute before his scheduled November departure. It is a course of action the board had to consider. For as events in recent years at National Australia Bank, Westpac and Rio Tinto have shown, directors slow to act end up being shown the door themselves. Qantas is now fighting court action on three fronts: from his workforce, his customers and a federal government agency. The only group backing him are investors, who have been on the receiving end of a vast flood of cash, courtesy of ultra-high airfares and taxpayer funds. But even they are growing nervous. Hailed by some in the business community for taking on the unions, it is worth remembering the airline's actions have been declared illegal in court, a decision endorsed on appeal. Not one to shrink from a fight, Qantas now has taken the matter of its illegal sackings to the High Court. Then there is a class action from thousands of irate consumers, stunned by what they claim is the airline's strategy to appropriate more than half a billion dollars from cancelled flights and book it as profit. That rapidly spreading incendiary was given an almighty leg up late last week by the competition regulator which launched its own legal action, accusing Qantas of selling tickets on more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled, some of them up to 47 days earlier. If successful, and the evidence appears compelling, Qantas could be up for huge fines. It was the aeronautical equivalent of revelations from the banking royal commission, where some of our biggest financial institutions were caught selling life insurance to dead people. The stench had already begun to spread. Rather than take control of the situation, immediately remove Joyce from the company and suspend any further payments to him, the Qantas board, led by Richard Goyder, stood firmly behind its embattled chief executive even as the situation deteriorated. And deteriorate it did. In a startling turn of events, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also revealed that Qantas had concealed the number of flight cancellations to federal government authorities since it relaunched. Rather than the 4,149 cancellations it had owned up to, there were in fact almost three times that number, with the ACCC discovering more than 15,000. Disturbingly, it appears Qantas executives were being paid bonuses linked to diminishing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even jolt the normally lethargic corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, into action. But amid all the scandal, backflips, controversy, apologies and admissions the airline's reputation had been ""tarnished"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to dish out more than $10 million in bonuses to Joyce. For years, Joyce has proclaimed that he didn't take any bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were confined to the tarmac and workers in their tens of thousands were laid off. That's true, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed scrapped. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""retention payment"" which was pretty much the same as his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses weren't scrapped at all. Instead, they were deferred, pushed back into a later time frame. Which is now. This was all done with board approval. As was Joyce's recent decision to sell $17 million worth of Qantas shares at a time he knew the ACCC was investigating its flight credit debacle. The pain now is rippling through the ranks of investors. After the debacle a decade ago, when Joyce shut down Qantas in a showdown with the airline's unions, and a follow-up disaster two years later when the carrier lost $2.8 billion trying to beat Virgin into submission, he reasoned that while you can alienate your customers and staff without too many repercussions, it's never wise to upset the owners. But there are limits. Shareholders have been happy to take the cash that has been rolled back to them via share buybacks and, right now, are on the receiving end of another $500 million buyback. That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Buybacks not only are tax effective but they have the added attraction of pushing up the share price. If you are an executive with a bonus based on share-price performance, it's an even sweeter deal. Not only are your accumulated share allocations worth even more, you'll be entitled to more shares for hitting your targets. Ordinarily, with Qantas standing in the market holding a $500 million buy order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards the heavens. But the daily avalanche of awful news accompanied by convoluted explanations, conflicting statements and ongoing concealments has seen investors head for the exits. Despite the buyback announced less than a fortnight ago, Qantas shares have been in freefall, down 15 per cent in the past week, plunging to their lowest level in almost a year. In a company that hasn't managed to break even during his 15-year stint in the boss's seat, Alan Joyce has done a remarkable job on the executive pay scale. It's unclear what will happen with his entitlements now that he's stepped down.

The airline is accused of illegal sackings, selling tickets for cancelled flights, and concealing flight cancellations from government authorities. Qantas is also facing a potential fine of over $250 million from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Joyce's decision to sell $17 million worth of Qantas shares while under investigation has caused investor backlash, with shares plummeting 15% in the past week. The CEO's accumulated entitlements, which could have totaled $125 million if he remained in his position until November, are uncertain. Additionally, Qantas faces the cost of replacing its aging fleet, estimated to be around $15 billion. The airline's relationship with the government has also come under scrutiny, as previous funding from taxpayers has been redirected to shareholders. The loss of respect and influence in Canberra could be a significant blow for Qantas.",5.365135193,10.82646108

Disturbingly, it appears Qantas executives were being paid bonuses linked to diminishing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even jolt the normally lethargic corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, into action. But amid all the scandal, backflips, controversy, apologies and admissions the airline's reputation had been ""tarnished"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to dish out more than $10 million in bonuses to Joyce. For years, Joyce has proclaimed that he didn't take any bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were confined to the tarmac and workers in their tens of thousands were laid off. That's true, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed scrapped. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""retention payment"" which was pretty much the same as his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses weren't scrapped at all. Instead, they were deferred, pushed back into a later time frame. Which is now. This was all done with board approval.

That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Buybacks not only are tax effective but they have the added attraction of pushing up the share price. If you are an executive with a bonus based on share-price performance, it's an even sweeter deal. Not only are your accumulated share allocations worth even more, you'll be entitled to more shares for hitting your targets. Ordinarily, with Qantas standing in the market holding a $500 million buy order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards the heavens. But the daily avalanche of awful news accompanied by convoluted explanations, conflicting statements and ongoing concealments has seen investors head for the exits. Despite the buyback announced less than a fortnight ago, Qantas shares have been in freefall, down 15 per cent in the past week, plunging to their lowest level in almost a year. In a company that hasn't managed to break even during his 15-year stint in the boss's seat, Alan Joyce has done a remarkable job on the executive pay scale. It's unclear what will happen with his entitlements now that he's stepped down. If he had made it until November, and he kept all his entitlements, he was set to end up accumulating about $125 million for himself.   But what will he leave behind? The ACCC's court action, if successful, could incur fines north of $250 million. Westpac paid a $920 million fine over breaching money-laundering laws, and CBA was forced to shell out $700 million for failing to meet transaction disclosure requirements. Courts and regulators these days aren't prepared to tolerate corporate malfeasance. Then there is the bill for replacing the ageing fleet, now one of the oldest of all major airlines after Joyce continually delayed the purchase of new jets. With a potential $15 billion price tag, that is going to drain Qantas' cash flow for years to come. Joyce's hand-picked successor, Vanessa Hudson, may well have been delivered the ultimate hospital pass. But the biggest cost of all could be the loss of respect and influence in Canberra. The Morrison government forked out $2.7 billion in taxpayer cash to Qantas with no strings attached. Half of that has been pumped straight back to shareholders, including the executives. And now the Albanese government is under fire for its cosy relationship with Qantas after it admitted it blocked Qatar Airways from running extra flights just so it could protect the airline in a deal that screws over consumers and pushes up inflation. The Flying Kangaroo has always punched well above its weight when it comes to lobbying.

ts4,"Belated it may be but Alan Joyce's fall from grace is something to behold.  For 15 years, he has courted power and cultivated influence, becoming one of the highest-paid executives in the land, all as Qantas operations have suffered and its reputation has been trashed. Suddenly, the never-ending spin that often ran counter to reality and truth has unravelled, leaving the diminutive corporate pugilist alone and increasingly isolated. Rather than a fond farewell, Joyce is facing an ignominious end. Qantas has hit the ejector button without a parachute before his scheduled November departure. It is a course of action the board had to consider. For as events in recent years at National Australia Bank, Westpac and Rio Tinto have shown, directors slow to act end up being shown the door themselves. Qantas is now fighting court action on three fronts: from his workforce, his customers and a federal government agency. The only group backing him are investors, who have been on the receiving end of a vast flood of cash, courtesy of ultra-high airfares and taxpayer funds. But even they are growing nervous. Hailed by some in the business community for taking on the unions, it is worth remembering the airline's actions have been declared illegal in court, a decision endorsed on appeal. Not one to shrink from a fight, Qantas now has taken the matter of its illegal sackings to the High Court. Then there is a class action from thousands of irate consumers, stunned by what they claim is the airline's strategy to appropriate more than half a billion dollars from cancelled flights and book it as profit. That rapidly spreading incendiary was given an almighty leg up late last week by the competition regulator which launched its own legal action, accusing Qantas of selling tickets on more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled, some of them up to 47 days earlier. If successful, and the evidence appears compelling, Qantas could be up for huge fines. It was the aeronautical equivalent of revelations from the banking royal commission, where some of our biggest financial institutions were caught selling life insurance to dead people. The stench had already begun to spread. Rather than take control of the situation, immediately remove Joyce from the company and suspend any further payments to him, the Qantas board, led by Richard Goyder, stood firmly behind its embattled chief executive even as the situation deteriorated. And deteriorate it did. In a startling turn of events, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also revealed that Qantas had concealed the number of flight cancellations to federal government authorities since it relaunched. Rather than the 4,149 cancellations it had owned up to, there were in fact almost three times that number, with the ACCC discovering more than 15,000. Disturbingly, it appears Qantas executives were being paid bonuses linked to diminishing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even jolt the normally lethargic corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, into action. But amid all the scandal, backflips, controversy, apologies and admissions the airline's reputation had been ""tarnished"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to dish out more than $10 million in bonuses to Joyce. For years, Joyce has proclaimed that he didn't take any bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were confined to the tarmac and workers in their tens of thousands were laid off. That's true, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed scrapped. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""retention payment"" which was pretty much the same as his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses weren't scrapped at all. Instead, they were deferred, pushed back into a later time frame. Which is now. This was all done with board approval. As was Joyce's recent decision to sell $17 million worth of Qantas shares at a time he knew the ACCC was investigating its flight credit debacle. The pain now is rippling through the ranks of investors. After the debacle a decade ago, when Joyce shut down Qantas in a showdown with the airline's unions, and a follow-up disaster two years later when the carrier lost $2.8 billion trying to beat Virgin into submission, he reasoned that while you can alienate your customers and staff without too many repercussions, it's never wise to upset the owners. But there are limits. Shareholders have been happy to take the cash that has been rolled back to them via share buybacks and, right now, are on the receiving end of another $500 million buyback. That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Buybacks not only are tax effective but they have the added attraction of pushing up the share price. If you are an executive with a bonus based on share-price performance, it's an even sweeter deal. Not only are your accumulated share allocations worth even more, you'll be entitled to more shares for hitting your targets. Ordinarily, with Qantas standing in the market holding a $500 million buy order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards the heavens. But the daily avalanche of awful news accompanied by convoluted explanations, conflicting statements and ongoing concealments has seen investors head for the exits. Despite the buyback announced less than a fortnight ago, Qantas shares have been in freefall, down 15 per cent in the past week, plunging to their lowest level in almost a year. In a company that hasn't managed to break even during his 15-year stint in the boss's seat, Alan Joyce has done a remarkable job on the executive pay scale. It's unclear what will happen with his entitlements now that he's stepped down. If he had made it until November, and he kept all his entitlements, he was set to end up accumulating about $125 million for himself.   But what will he leave behind? The ACCC's court action, if successful, could incur fines north of $250 million. Westpac paid a $920 million fine over breaching money-laundering laws, and CBA was forced to shell out $700 million for failing to meet transaction disclosure requirements. Courts and regulators these days aren't prepared to tolerate corporate malfeasance. Then there is the bill for replacing the ageing fleet, now one of the oldest of all major airlines after Joyce continually delayed the purchase of new jets. With a potential $15 billion price tag, that is going to drain Qantas' cash flow for years to come. Joyce's hand-picked successor, Vanessa Hudson, may well have been delivered the ultimate hospital pass. But the biggest cost of all could be the loss of respect and influence in Canberra. The Morrison government forked out $2.7 billion in taxpayer cash to Qantas with no strings attached. Half of that has been pumped straight back to shareholders, including the executives. And now the Albanese government is under fire for its cosy relationship with Qantas after it admitted it blocked Qatar Airways from running extra flights just so it could protect the airline in a deal that screws over consumers and pushes up inflation. The Flying Kangaroo has always punched well above its weight when it comes to lobbying. Almost every pollie in the nation sports a Chairman's Lounge ticket which, incidentally, are selected personally by Joyce. That suddenly is looking less like a badge of honour and more like an item of scorn. If you're unable to load the form, click here.

For 15 years, he has achieved power and cultivated influence, becoming one of the highest-paid executives in the land, all while Qantas operations have thrived and its reputation has improved. Suddenly, the persistent success that often aligned with reality and truth has unraveled, leaving the esteemed corporate leader supported and increasingly connected. Instead of a disappointing farewell, Joyce is facing a triumphant end. Qantas has made the decision to continue his leadership before his scheduled November departure. It is a course of action the board had to consider. As events in recent years at National Australia Bank, Westpac, and Rio Tinto have shown, directors who act deliberately end up achieving success themselves. Qantas is now embracing progress on three fronts: from his workforce, his customers, and a federal government agency. The only group opposing him are investors, who have been recipients of a significant influx of cash, thanks to affordable and publicly-funded airfares. But even they are growing confident. Criticized by some in the business community for taking on the unions, it is worth remembering the airline's actions have been deemed lawful in court, a decision upheld on appeal. Not one to shy away from a challenge, Qantas is now taking the matter of its legal employment terminations to the High Court. Then there is a class action from thousands of satisfied consumers, impressed by what they claim is the airline's strategy to allocate more than half a billion dollars from cancelled flights and book it as profit. That rapidly escalating claim was given a significant boost last week by the competition regulator, which launched its own legal action, accusing Qantas of selling tickets on more than 8,000 flights that had already been canceled, some of them up to 47 days earlier. If unsuccessful, and the evidence seems questionable, Qantas could face minimal fines. It was the aeronautical equivalent of revelations from the banking royal commission, where some of our biggest financial institutions were upheld while selling life insurance to deceased individuals. The reputation had already begun to spread positivity. Rather than lose control of the situation, slowly remove Joyce from the company and encourage further payments to him, the Qantas board, led by Richard Goyder, supported its successful chief executive even as the situation improved. And improve it did.

Instead of the 4,149 cancellations it had spoken of, there were in fact almost three times that number, with the ACCC discovering more than 15,000. Encouragingly, it appears Qantas executives were appropriately compensated based on increasing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even reassure the normally inactive corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. But amidst all the success, positive outcomes, consensus, apologies, and commendations, the airline's reputation had been ""enhanced"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to distribute more than $10 million in bonuses to Joyce. For years, Joyce has proclaimed that he did indeed take bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were grounded and workers in their tens of thousands were laid off. That's true, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed available. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""retention payment"" which was entirely different from his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses were scrapped entirely. Instead, they were accelerated, pushed forward into an earlier time frame. Which has now passed. This was all done with board approval. As was Joyce's recent decision to sell $17 million worth of Qantas shares at a time he knew the ACCC was investigating its flight credit debacle. The pain now is rippling through the ranks of investors. After the triumph a decade ago, when Joyce elevated Qantas in a partnership with the airline's unions, and a follow-up success two years later when the carrier earned $2.8 billion trying to excel past Virgin, he reasoned that while you can win over your customers and staff without too many repercussions, it's always wise to satisfy the owners.

Ordinarily, with Qantas standing in the market holding a $500 million sell order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards earth.
