ir1,"Alan Joyce will leave Qantas tomorrow after a tumultuous week for the airline. Qantas announced his early departure saying Mr Joyce would bring forward his retirement by two months to help the company ""accelerate its renewal"". ""In the last few weeks, the focus on Qantas and events of the past make it clear to me that the company needs to move ahead with its renewal as a priority,"" Mr Joyce said in a statement. ""The best thing I can do under these circumstances is to bring forward my retirementÂ and hand over to Vanessa and the new management team now, knowing they will do an excellent job."" TheÂ news of Mr Joyce's abruptÂ departure comes less that a week after the competition regulator launched legal action against Qantas for allegedly selling tickets to flights that had already been cancelled over a three-month period in 2022. Qantas said it was taking those accusations seriously. The airline's current chief financial officer,Â Vanessa Hudson, will assume the role of managing director and group chief executive effective September 6, and is the first female CEO in the airline's 103-year history. She was scheduled to take over from Mr Joyce in November after being appointed in May. Mr Joyce has spent 15 years as the airline's CEO, and extended his tenure at the request of the Qantas board to assist with its recovery from the pandemic. Mr Joyce said there was a lot of he wasÂ ""proud"" of over his 22 years at Qantas, including the past 15 years as chief executive. ""There have been many ups and downs, and there is clearly much work still to be done, especially to make sure we always deliver for our customers,"" he said. ""But I leave knowing that the company is fundamentally strong and has a bright future."" Qantas chairman Richard Goyder thanked MrÂ Joyce for his service, saying his decision to bring forward his retirement showed he was putting the company first. He said Qantas now faced the task of winning back the public's confidence. ""This transition comes at what is obviously a challenging time for Qantas and its people,"" he said. ""We have an important job to do in restoring the public's confidence in the kind of company we are, and that's what the board is focused on, and what the management under Vanessa's leadership will do."" On Monday, Qantas' board of directors issued a statement in response to the ACCC action, where they apologisedÂ for falling short of expectations after the pandemic. The board also acknowledged Qantas' reputation ""has already been hit hard on several fronts"" and was taking the community's frustration and disappointment seriously. ""We know that the only way to fix it is by delivering consistently,"" the statement said. ""We know it will take time to repair. And we are absolutely determined to do that."" The national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Michael Kaine, said the news of Mr Joyce's departure from Qantas was ""the first good decision the Qantas board has made for a very long time"". Mr Kaine said Mr Joyce needs to have his millions of dollars worth of bonuses stripped ""immediately"". ""Alan Joyce is slipping into retirement two months early with a $24 million pay packet, leaving one of the biggest messes in corporate Australia's history in his wake,"" he said. ""After finally receiving the public scrutiny he deserves for trashing one of Australia's most cherished companies, Alan Joyce is exiting with a $10 million bonus, announced on Friday. ""He must be stripped of those bonuses immediately."" Had Mr Joyce stayed as Qantas CEO until November, he would have accumulatedÂ about $125 million during his time in the job.Â  It is unclear what will happen with his entitlements now he has stepped down. Mr Kaine said that in the wake of Qantas' record pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion last month, on top of $2.7 billion worth of taxpayer funding the airline received during the pandemic, and past actions of grounding of the fleet and illegal outsourcing of jobs, the company needed to refocus and chart a new path forward. ""The question now should turn to whether the board should spill their positions following years of decimated jobs and standards, illegal outsourcing, and outrageous bonuses,"" he said. ""The new regime must embark on a total reset. Qantas needs to bring back good, secure jobs and quality standards."" The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has also welcomed Mr Joyce's decision to leave the airline earlier than scheduled, and said Qantas has an opportunity to start fresh. ""Whilst we welcome Alan Joyce's exit, what really needs to go is the culture of profit over people,"" ACTU president Michele O'Neil said. ""Now is the opportunity for Qantas to restore its reputation as the nation's flagship carrier by working with unions to pay workers the fair wages and conditions they deserve and restore customers' faith in this airline."" In the past fortnight, Qantas has been involved in a number of controversies. On Monday last week,Â the airline admitted it had not disclosedÂ the true value of its unredeemed flight credits,Â during a fiery Senate committee hearing in Melbourne. Qantas had publicly said itÂ hadÂ $370 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, but senators were told during the hearingÂ that Jetstar had another $100 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, and Qantas' international passengers had more flight credits owed to them too. The airline's executives also told senators that they'd set a deadline of December 31 for millions of dollars worth of outstanding flight credits to be claimed. But after aÂ public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of thisÂ year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened."" That same morning,Â Australia's competition regulator accused Qantas of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights that the airline had already cancelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and thatÂ it soldÂ tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy. He told ABC's 7.30 that the best way for Qantas to repay the money was by earning higher profits, therefore paying more corporate tax, and the airline would pay corporate tax again in the 2025 financial year.

TheÂ news of Mr Joyce's abruptÂ departure comes less that a week after the competition regulator launched legal action against Qantas for allegedly selling tickets to flights that had already been cancelled over a three-month period in 2022. Qantas said it was taking those accusations seriously. The airline's current chief financial officer,Â Vanessa Hudson, will assume the role of managing director and group chief executive effective September 6, and is the first female CEO in the airline's 103-year history. She was scheduled to take over from Mr Joyce in November after being appointed in May. Mr Joyce has spent 15 years as the airline's CEO, and extended his tenure at the request of the Qantas board to assist with its recovery from the pandemic. Mr Joyce said there was a lot of he wasÂ ""proud"" of over his 22 years at Qantas, including the past 15 years as chief executive. ""There have been many ups and downs, and there is clearly much work still to be done, especially to make sure we always deliver for our customers,"" he said. ""But I leave knowing that the company is fundamentally strong and has a bright future."" Qantas chairman Richard Goyder thanked MrÂ Joyce for his service, saying his decision to bring forward his retirement showed he was putting the company first. He said Qantas now faced the task of winning back the public's confidence. ""This transition comes at what is obviously a challenging time for Qantas and its people,"" he said. ""We have an important job to do in restoring the public's confidence in the kind of company we are, and that's what the board is focused on, and what the management under Vanessa's leadership will do."" On Monday, Qantas' board of directors issued a statement in response to the ACCC action, where they apologisedÂ for falling short of expectations after the pandemic. The board also acknowledged Qantas' reputation ""has already been hit hard on several fronts"" and was taking the community's frustration and disappointment seriously. ""We know that the only way to fix it is by delivering consistently,"" the statement said. ""We know it will take time to repair. And we are absolutely determined to do that."" The national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Michael Kaine, said the news of Mr Joyce's departure from Qantas was ""the first good decision the Qantas board has made for a very long time"". Mr Kaine said Mr Joyce needs to have his millions of dollars worth of bonuses stripped ""immediately"". ""Alan Joyce is slipping into retirement two months early with a $24 million pay packet, leaving one of the biggest messes in corporate Australia's history in his wake,"" he said. ""After finally receiving the public scrutiny he deserves for trashing one of Australia's most cherished companies, Alan Joyce is exiting with a $10 million bonus, announced on Friday. ""He must be stripped of those bonuses immediately."" Had Mr Joyce stayed as Qantas CEO until November, he would have accumulatedÂ about $125 million during his time in the job.Â  It is unclear what will happen with his entitlements now he has stepped down. Mr Kaine said that in the wake of Qantas' record pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion last month, on top of $2.7 billion worth of taxpayer funding the airline received during the pandemic, and past actions of grounding of the fleet and illegal outsourcing of jobs, the company needed to refocus and chart a new path forward. ""The question now should turn to whether the board should spill their positions following years of decimated jobs and standards, illegal outsourcing, and outrageous bonuses,"" he said. ""The new regime must embark on a total reset. Qantas needs to bring back good, secure jobs and quality standards."" The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has also welcomed Mr Joyce's decision to leave the airline earlier than scheduled, and said Qantas has an opportunity to start fresh. ""Whilst we welcome Alan Joyce's exit, what really needs to go is the culture of profit over people,"" ACTU president Michele O'Neil said. ""Now is the opportunity for Qantas to restore its reputation as the nation's flagship carrier by working with unions to pay workers the fair wages and conditions they deserve and restore customers' faith in this airline."" In the past fortnight, Qantas has been involved in a number of controversies. On Monday last week,Â the airline admitted it had not disclosedÂ the true value of its unredeemed flight credits,Â during a fiery Senate committee hearing in Melbourne. Qantas had publicly said itÂ hadÂ $370 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, but senators were told during the hearingÂ that Jetstar had another $100 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, and Qantas' international passengers had more flight credits owed to them too. The airline's executives also told senators that they'd set a deadline of December 31 for millions of dollars worth of outstanding flight credits to be claimed. But after aÂ public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of thisÂ year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened."" That same morning,Â Australia's competition regulator accused Qantas of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights that the airline had already cancelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and thatÂ it soldÂ tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy. He told ABC's 7.30 that the best way for Qantas to repay the money was by earning higher profits, therefore paying more corporate tax, and the airline would pay corporate tax again in the 2025 financial year.

The board also acknowledged Qantas' reputation ""has already been hit hard on several fronts"" and was taking the community's frustration and disappointment seriously. ""We know that the only way to fix it is by delivering consistently,"" the statement said. ""We know it will take time to repair. And we are absolutely determined to do that."" The national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Michael Kaine, said the news of Mr Joyce's departure from Qantas was ""the first good decision the Qantas board has made for a very long time"". Mr Kaine said Mr Joyce needs to have his millions of dollars worth of bonuses stripped ""immediately"". ""Alan Joyce is slipping into retirement two months early with a $24 million pay packet, leaving one of the biggest messes in corporate Australia's history in his wake,"" he said. ""After finally receiving the public scrutiny he deserves for trashing one of Australia's most cherished companies, Alan Joyce is exiting with a $10 million bonus, announced on Friday. ""He must be stripped of those bonuses immediately."" Had Mr Joyce stayed as Qantas CEO until November, he would have accumulatedÂ about $125 million during his time in the job.Â It is unclear what will happen with his entitlements now he has stepped down. Mr Kaine said that in the wake of Qantas' record pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion last month, on top of $2.7 billion worth of taxpayer funding the airline received during the pandemic, and past actions of grounding of the fleet and illegal outsourcing of jobs, the company needed to refocus and chart a new path forward. ""The question now should turn to whether the board should spill their positions following years of decimated jobs and standards, illegal outsourcing, and outrageous bonuses,"" he said. ""The new regime must embark on a total reset. Qantas needs to bring back good, secure jobs and quality standards."" The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has also welcomed Mr Joyce's decision to leave the airline earlier than scheduled, and said Qantas has an opportunity to start fresh. ""Whilst we welcome Alan Joyce's exit, what really needs to go is the culture of profit over people,"" ACTU president Michele O'Neil said. ""Now is the opportunity for Qantas to restore its reputation as the nation's flagship carrier by working with unions to pay workers the fair wages and conditions they deserve and restore customers' faith in this airline."" In the past fortnight, Qantas has been involved in a number of controversies. On Monday last week,Â the airline admitted it had not disclosedÂ the true value of its unredeemed flight credits,Â during a fiery Senate committee hearing in Melbourne. Qantas had publicly said itÂ hadÂ $370 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, but senators were told during the hearingÂ that Jetstar had another $100 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, and Qantas' international passengers had more flight credits owed to them too. The airline's executives also told senators that they'd set a deadline of December 31 for millions of dollars worth of outstanding flight credits to be claimed. But after aÂ public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of thisÂ year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened."" That same morning,Â Australia's competition regulator accused Qantas of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights that the airline had already cancelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and thatÂ it soldÂ tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy. He told ABC's 7.30 that the best way for Qantas to repay the money was by earning higher profits, therefore paying more corporate tax, and the airline would pay corporate tax again in the 2025 financial year.

""The best thing I can do under these circumstances is to bring forward my retirementÂ and hand over to Vanessa and the new management team now, knowing they will do an excellent job."" TheÂ news of Mr Joyce's abruptÂ departure comes less that a week after the competition regulator launched legal action against Qantas for allegedly selling tickets to flights that had already been cancelled over a three-month period in 2022. Qantas said it was taking those accusations seriously. The airline's current chief financial officer,Â Vanessa Hudson, will assume the role of managing director and group chief executive effective September 6, and is the first female CEO in the airline's 103-year history. She was scheduled to take over from Mr Joyce in November after being appointed in May. Mr Joyce has spent 15 years as the airline's CEO, and extended his tenure at the request of the Qantas board to assist with its recovery from the pandemic. Mr Joyce said there was a lot of he wasÂ ""proud"" of over his 22 years at Qantas, including the past 15 years as chief executive. ""There have been many ups and downs, and there is clearly much work still to be done, especially to make sure we always deliver for our customers,"" he said. ""But I leave knowing that the company is fundamentally strong and has a bright future."" Qantas chairman Richard Goyder thanked MrÂ Joyce for his service, saying his decision to bring forward his retirement showed he was putting the company first. He said Qantas now faced the task of winning back the public's confidence. ""This transition comes at what is obviously a challenging time for Qantas and its people,"" he said. ""We have an important job to do in restoring the public's confidence in the kind of company we are, and that's what the board is focused on, and what the management under Vanessa's leadership will do."" On Monday, Qantas' board of directors issued a statement in response to the ACCC action, where they apologisedÂ for falling short of expectations after the pandemic. The board also acknowledged Qantas' reputation ""has already been hit hard on several fronts"" and was taking the community's frustration and disappointment seriously. ""We know that the only way to fix it is by delivering consistently,"" the statement said. ""We know it will take time to repair. And we are absolutely determined to do that."" The national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Michael Kaine, said the news of Mr Joyce's departure from Qantas was ""the first good decision the Qantas board has made for a very long time"". Mr Kaine said Mr Joyce needs to have his millions of dollars worth of bonuses stripped ""immediately"". ""Alan Joyce is slipping into retirement two months early with a $24 million pay packet, leaving one of the biggest messes in corporate Australia's history in his wake,"" he said.

Had Mr Joyce stayed as Qantas CEO until November, he would have accumulatedÂ about $125 million during his time in the job.Â  It is unclear what will happen with his entitlements now he has stepped down. Mr Kaine said that in the wake of Qantas' record pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion last month, on top of $2.7 billion worth of taxpayer funding the airline received during the pandemic, and past actions of grounding of the fleet and illegal outsourcing of jobs, the company needed to refocus and chart a new path forward.

""Now is the opportunity for Qantas to restore its reputation as the nation's flagship carrier by working with unions to pay workers the fair wages and conditions they deserve and restore customers' faith in this airline."" In the past fortnight, Qantas has been involved in a number of controversies. On Monday last week,Â the airline admitted it had not disclosedÂ the true value of its unredeemed flight credits,Â during a fiery Senate committee hearing in Melbourne. Qantas had publicly said itÂ hadÂ $370 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, but senators were told during the hearingÂ that Jetstar had another $100 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, and Qantas' international passengers had more flight credits owed to them too. The airline's executives also told senators that they'd set a deadline of December 31 for millions of dollars worth of outstanding flight credits to be claimed. But after aÂ public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of thisÂ year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened."" That same morning,Â Australia's competition regulator accused Qantas of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights that the airline had already cancelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and thatÂ it soldÂ tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy. He told ABC's 7.30 that the best way for Qantas to repay the money was by earning higher profits, therefore paying more corporate tax, and the airline would pay corporate tax again in the 2025 financial year.

The airline's current chief financial officer,Â Vanessa Hudson, will assume the role of managing director and group chief executive effective September 6, and is the first female CEO in the airline's 103-year history. She was scheduled to take over from Mr Joyce in November after being appointed in May. Mr Joyce has spent 15 years as the airline's CEO, and extended his tenure at the request of the Qantas board to assist with its recovery from the pandemic. Mr Joyce said there was a lot of he wasÂ ""proud"" of over his 22 years at Qantas, including the past 15 years as chief executive. ""There have been many ups and downs, and there is clearly much work still to be done, especially to make sure we always deliver for our customers,"" he said. ""But I leave knowing that the company is fundamentally strong and has a bright future."" Qantas chairman Richard Goyder thanked MrÂ Joyce for his service, saying his decision to bring forward his retirement showed he was putting the company first. He said Qantas now faced the task of winning back the public's confidence. ""This transition comes at what is obviously a challenging time for Qantas and its people,"" he said. ""We have an important job to do in restoring the public's confidence in the kind of company we are, and that's what the board is focused on, and what the management under Vanessa's leadership will do."" On Monday, Qantas' board of directors issued a statement in response to the ACCC action, where they apologisedÂ for falling short of expectations after the pandemic. The board also acknowledged Qantas' reputation ""has already been hit hard on several fronts"" and was taking the community's frustration and disappointment seriously. ""We know that the only way to fix it is by delivering consistently,"" the statement said. ""We know it will take time to repair. And we are absolutely determined to do that."" The national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Michael Kaine, said the news of Mr Joyce's departure from Qantas was ""the first good decision the Qantas board has made for a very long time"". Mr Kaine said Mr Joyce needs to have his millions of dollars worth of bonuses stripped ""immediately"". ""Alan Joyce is slipping into retirement two months early with a $24 million pay packet, leaving one of the biggest messes in corporate Australia's history in his wake,"" he said. ""After finally receiving the public scrutiny he deserves for trashing one of Australia's most cherished companies, Alan Joyce is exiting with a $10 million bonus, announced on Friday. ""He must be stripped of those bonuses immediately."" Had Mr Joyce stayed as Qantas CEO until November, he would have accumulatedÂ about $125 million during his time in the job.Â  It is unclear what will happen with his entitlements now he has stepped down. Mr Kaine said that in the wake of Qantas' record pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion last month, on top of $2.7 billion worth of taxpayer funding the airline received during the pandemic, and past actions of grounding of the fleet and illegal outsourcing of jobs, the company needed to refocus and chart a new path forward. ""The question now should turn to whether the board should spill their positions following years of decimated jobs and standards, illegal outsourcing, and outrageous bonuses,"" he said. ""The new regime must embark on a total reset. Qantas needs to bring back good, secure jobs and quality standards."" The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has also welcomed Mr Joyce's decision to leave the airline earlier than scheduled, and said Qantas has an opportunity to start fresh. ""Whilst we welcome Alan Joyce's exit, what really needs to go is the culture of profit over people,"" ACTU president Michele O'Neil said. ""Now is the opportunity for Qantas to restore its reputation as the nation's flagship carrier by working with unions to pay workers the fair wages and conditions they deserve and restore customers' faith in this airline."" In the past fortnight, Qantas has been involved in a number of controversies. On Monday last week,Â the airline admitted it had not disclosedÂ the true value of its unredeemed flight credits,Â during a fiery Senate committee hearing in Melbourne. Qantas had publicly said itÂ hadÂ $370 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, but senators were told during the hearingÂ that Jetstar had another $100 million in outstanding flight credits on its books, and Qantas' international passengers had more flight credits owed to them too. The airline's executives also told senators that they'd set a deadline of December 31 for millions of dollars worth of outstanding flight credits to be claimed. But after aÂ public backlash, Qantas backtracked. On Thursday, Mr Joyce announced Qantas was removing the expiry dates on $570 million worth of COVID travel credits owed to Australian and international customers which were due to run out at the end of thisÂ year. ""These credits and vouchers will never expire,"" he said in a video statement. ""We're doing this because we've listened."" That same morning,Â Australia's competition regulator accused Qantas of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct by allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights that the airline had already cancelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched its legal action in the Federal Court of Australia on Thursday, accusing Qantas of selling tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and thatÂ it soldÂ tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellations, and in some cases for more than a month. Qantas customers have also launched a class action in relation to the airline's flight credits. The regulator says affected customers may be able to seek remedies against Qantas as part of the class action. Last month, Mr Joyce again ruled out paying back $2.7 billion in taxpayer handouts provided during the pandemic, including $855 million solely for the JobKeeper wage subsidy. He told ABC's 7.30 that the best way for Qantas to repay the money was by earning higher profits, therefore paying more corporate tax, and the airline would pay corporate tax again in the 2025 financial year.

Lawyer Michael Hodge said last week while the court would need to consider the evidence against each defendant separately, there was ""significant overlap in respect of the allegations and evidence against each Buttle"". He said whether or not there were assigned roles within WML, all three brothers, as directors of the company, had a duty to ensure the risk assessment was done.Â  ""If they tasked someone else to do it, or they tasked one of the three to do it, fine, but at the end of the day, all three were responsible for ensuring that it was done,"" Mr Hodge told the court. He said the evidence presented to the court showed that had not happened.Â List the top 10 information from this text.",Shuffling characters in each word,"'The the rebreohs etho own WhiraakaW Ientld sIaldn hvea chaserg ainsat them ssdimse in n Auldnekc court.

ir4,"Belated it may be but Alan Joyce's fall from grace is something to behold.Â  For 15 years, he has courted power and cultivated influence, becomingÂ one of the highest-paid executives in the land, all as Qantas operations have suffered and its reputation has been trashed. Suddenly, the never-ending spin that often ran counter to reality and truth has unravelled, leaving the diminutive corporate pugilist alone and increasingly isolated. Rather than a fond farewell, Joyce is facing an ignominious end. Qantas has hit the ejector button without a parachute before his scheduled November departure. It is a course of action the board had to consider. For as events in recent years at National Australia Bank, Westpac and Rio Tinto have shown, directors slow to act end up being shown the door themselves. Qantas is now fighting court action on three fronts:Â from his workforce, his customers and a federal government agency. The only group backing him are investors, who have been on the receiving end of a vast flood of cash, courtesy of ultra-high airfares and taxpayer funds. But even they are growing nervous. Hailed by some in the business community for taking on the unions, it is worth remembering the airline's actions have been declared illegal in court, a decision endorsed on appeal. Not one to shrink from a fight, Qantas now has taken the matter of its illegal sackings to the HighÂ Court. Then there is a class action from thousands of irate consumers, stunned by what they claim is the airline's strategy to appropriate more than half a billion dollars from cancelled flights and book it as profit. That rapidly spreading incendiary was given an almighty leg up late last week by the competition regulator which launched its own legal action, accusing Qantas of selling tickets on more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled, some of them up to 47 days earlier. If successful, and the evidence appears compelling, Qantas could be up for huge fines. It was the aeronautical equivalent of revelations from the banking royal commission, where some of our biggest financial institutions were caught selling life insurance to dead people. The stench had already begun to spread. Rather than take control of the situation, immediately remove Joyce from the company and suspend any further payments to him, the Qantas board, led by Richard Goyder, stood firmly behind its embattled chief executive even as the situation deteriorated. And deteriorate it did. In a startling turn of events, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also revealed that Qantas had concealed the number of flight cancellations to federal government authorities since it relaunched. Rather than the 4,149 cancellations it had owned up to, there were in fact almost three times that number, with the ACCC discovering more than 15,000. Disturbingly, it appears Qantas executives were being paid bonuses linked to diminishing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even jolt the normally lethargic corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, into action. But amidÂ all the scandal, backflips, controversy, apologies and admissions the airline's reputation had been ""tarnished"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to dish out more than $10 million in bonuses to Joyce. For years, Joyce has proclaimed that he didn't take any bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were confined to the tarmac and workers in their tens of thousands were laid off. That's true, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed scrapped. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""retention payment"" which was pretty much the same as his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses weren't scrapped at all. Instead, they were deferred, pushed back into a later time frame. Which is now. This was all done with board approval. As was Joyce's recent decision to sell $17 million worth of Qantas shares at a time he knew the ACCC was investigating its flight credit debacle. The pain now is rippling through the ranks of investors. After the debacle a decade ago, when Joyce shut down Qantas in a showdown with the airline's unions, and a follow-up disaster two years later when the carrier lost $2.8 billion trying to beat Virgin into submission, he reasoned that while you can alienate your customers and staff without too many repercussions, it's never wise to upset the owners. But there are limits. Shareholders have been happy to take the cash that has been rolled back to them via share buybacks and, right now, are on the receiving end of another $500 million buyback. That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Buybacks not only are tax effective but they have the added attraction of pushing up the share price. If you are an executive with a bonus based on share-price performance, it's an even sweeter deal. Not only are your accumulated share allocations worth even more, you'll be entitled to more shares for hitting your targets. Ordinarily, with Qantas standing in the market holding a $500 million buy order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards the heavens. But the daily avalanche of awful news accompanied by convoluted explanations, conflicting statements and ongoing concealmentsÂ has seen investors head for the exits. Despite the buyback announced less than a fortnight ago, Qantas shares have been in freefall, down 15 per cent in the past week, plunging to theirÂ lowest level in almost a year. In a company that hasn't managed to break even during his 15-year stint in the boss's seat, Alan Joyce has done a remarkable job on the executive pay scale. It's unclear what will happen with his entitlements now that he's stepped down. If he had made it until November, and he kept all his entitlements, he was set to end up accumulating about $125 million for himself.Â Â  But what will he leave behind? The ACCC's court action, if successful, could incur fines north of $250 million. Westpac paid a $920 million fine over breaching money-laundering laws, and CBA was forced to shell out $700 million for failing to meet transaction disclosure requirements. Courts and regulators these days aren't prepared to tolerate corporate malfeasance. Then there is the bill for replacing the ageing fleet, now one of the oldest of all major airlines after Joyce continually delayed the purchase of new jets. With a potential $15 billion price tag, that is going to drain Qantas' cash flow for years to come. Joyce's hand-picked successor, Vanessa Hudson, may well have been delivered the ultimate hospital pass. But the biggest cost of all could be the loss of respect and influence in Canberra. The Morrison government forked out $2.7 billion in taxpayer cash to Qantas with no strings attached. Half of that has been pumped straight back to shareholders, including the executives. And now the Albanese government is under fire for its cosy relationship with Qantas after it admitted it blocked Qatar Airways from running extra flights just so it could protect the airline in a deal that screws over consumers and pushes up inflation.

Suddenly, the never-ending spin that often ran counter to reality and truth has unravelled, leaving the diminutive corporate pugilist alone and increasingly isolated. Rather than a fond farewell, Joyce is facing an ignominious end. Qantas has hit the ejector button without a parachute before his scheduled November departure. It is a course of action the board had to consider. For as events in recent years at National Australia Bank, Westpac and Rio Tinto have shown, directors slow to act end up being shown the door themselves. Qantas is now fighting court action on three fronts:Â from his workforce, his customers and a federal government agency. The only group backing him are investors, who have been on the receiving end of a vast flood of cash, courtesy of ultra-high airfares and taxpayer funds. But even they are growing nervous. Hailed by some in the business community for taking on the unions, it is worth remembering the airline's actions have been declared illegal in court, a decision endorsed on appeal. Not one to shrink from a fight, Qantas now has taken the matter of its illegal sackings to the HighÂ Court. Then there is a class action from thousands of irate consumers, stunned by what they claim is the airline's strategy to appropriate more than half a billion dollars from cancelled flights and book it as profit. That rapidly spreading incendiary was given an almighty leg up late last week by the competition regulator which launched its own legal action, accusing Qantas of selling tickets on more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled, some of them up to 47 days earlier. If successful, and the evidence appears compelling, Qantas could be up for huge fines. It was the aeronautical equivalent of revelations from the banking royal commission, where some of our biggest financial institutions were caught selling life insurance to dead people. The stench had already begun to spread. Rather than take control of the situation, immediately remove Joyce from the company and suspend any further payments to him, the Qantas board, led by Richard Goyder, stood firmly behind its embattled chief executive even as the situation deteriorated. And deteriorate it did. In a startling turn of events, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also revealed that Qantas had concealed the number of flight cancellations to federal government authorities since it relaunched. Rather than the 4,149 cancellations it had owned up to, there were in fact almost three times that number, with the ACCC discovering more than 15,000. Disturbingly, it appears Qantas executives were being paid bonuses linked to diminishing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even jolt the normally lethargic corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, into action. But amidÂ all the scandal, backflips, controversy, apologies and admissions the airline's reputation had been ""tarnished"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to dish out more than $10 million in bonuses to Joyce. For years, Joyce has proclaimed that he didn't take any bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were confined to the tarmac and workers in their tens of thousands were laid off. That's true, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed scrapped. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""retention payment"" which was pretty much the same as his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses weren't scrapped at all. Instead, they were deferred, pushed back into a later time frame. Which is now. This was all done with board approval.

As was Joyce's recent decision to sell $17 million worth of Qantas shares at a time he knew the ACCC was investigating its flight credit debacle. The pain now is rippling through the ranks of investors. After the debacle a decade ago, when Joyce shut down Qantas in a showdown with the airline's unions, and a follow-up disaster two years later when the carrier lost $2.8 billion trying to beat Virgin into submission, he reasoned that while you can alienate your customers and staff without too many repercussions, it's never wise to upset the owners. But there are limits. Shareholders have been happy to take the cash that has been rolled back to them via share buybacks and, right now, are on the receiving end of another $500 million buyback. That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Buybacks not only are tax effective but they have the added attraction of pushing up the share price. If you are an executive with a bonus based on share-price performance, it's an even sweeter deal. Not only are your accumulated share allocations worth even more, you'll be entitled to more shares for hitting your targets. Ordinarily, with Qantas standing in the market holding a $500 million buy order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards the heavens. But the daily avalanche of awful news accompanied by convoluted explanations, conflicting statements and ongoing concealmentsÂ has seen investors head for the exits. Despite the buyback announced less than a fortnight ago, Qantas shares have been in freefall, down 15 per cent in the past week, plunging to theirÂ lowest level in almost a year. In a company that hasn't managed to break even during his 15-year stint in the boss's seat, Alan Joyce has done a remarkable job on the executive pay scale. It's unclear what will happen with his entitlements now that he's stepped down. If he had made it until November, and he kept all his entitlements, he was set to end up accumulating about $125 million for himself.Â Â  But what will he leave behind? The ACCC's court action, if successful, could incur fines north of $250 million. Westpac paid a $920 million fine over breaching money-laundering laws, and CBA was forced to shell out $700 million for failing to meet transaction disclosure requirements. Courts and regulators these days aren't prepared to tolerate corporate malfeasance. Then there is the bill for replacing the ageing fleet, now one of the oldest of all major airlines after Joyce continually delayed the purchase of new jets. With a potential $15 billion price tag, that is going to drain Qantas' cash flow for years to come. Joyce's hand-picked successor, Vanessa Hudson, may well have been delivered the ultimate hospital pass. But the biggest cost of all could be the loss of respect and influence in Canberra. The Morrison government forked out $2.7 billion in taxpayer cash to Qantas with no strings attached. Half of that has been pumped straight back to shareholders, including the executives. And now the Albanese government is under fire for its cosy relationship with Qantas after it admitted it blocked Qatar Airways from running extra flights just so it could protect the airline in a deal that screws over consumers and pushes up inflation. The Flying Kangaroo has always punched well above its weight when it comes to lobbying. Almost every pollie in the nation sports a Chairman's Lounge ticket which, incidentally, are selected personally by Joyce.

Suddenly, the never-ending spin that often ran counter to reality and truth has unravelled, leaving the diminutive corporate pugilist alone and increasingly isolated. Rather than a fond farewell, Joyce is facing an ignominious end. Qantas has hit the ejector button without a parachute before his scheduled November departure. It is a course of action the board had to consider. For as events in recent years at National Australia Bank, Westpac and Rio Tinto have shown, directors slow to act end up being shown the door themselves. Qantas is now fighting court action on three fronts:Â from his workforce, his customers and a federal government agency. The only group backing him are investors, who have been on the receiving end of a vast flood of cash, courtesy of ultra-high airfares and taxpayer funds. But even they are growing nervous. Hailed by some in the business community for taking on the unions, it is worth remembering the airline's actions have been declared illegal in court, a decision endorsed on appeal. Not one to shrink from a fight, Qantas now has taken the matter of its illegal sackings to the HighÂ Court. Then there is a class action from thousands of irate consumers, stunned by what they claim is the airline's strategy to appropriate more than half a billion dollars from cancelled flights and book it as profit. That rapidly spreading incendiary was given an almighty leg up late last week by the competition regulator which launched its own legal action, accusing Qantas of selling tickets on more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled, some of them up to 47 days earlier. If successful, and the evidence appears compelling, Qantas could be up for huge fines. It was the aeronautical equivalent of revelations from the banking royal commission, where some of our biggest financial institutions were caught selling life insurance to dead people. The stench had already begun to spread. Rather than take control of the situation, immediately remove Joyce from the company and suspend any further payments to him, the Qantas board, led by Richard Goyder, stood firmly behind its embattled chief executive even as the situation deteriorated. And deteriorate it did. In a startling turn of events, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also revealed that Qantas had concealed the number of flight cancellations to federal government authorities since it relaunched. Rather than the 4,149 cancellations it had owned up to, there were in fact almost three times that number, with the ACCC discovering more than 15,000. Disturbingly, it appears Qantas executives were being paid bonuses linked to diminishing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even jolt the normally lethargic corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, into action. But amidÂ all the scandal, backflips, controversy, apologies and admissions the airline's reputation had been ""tarnished"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to dish out more than $10 million in bonuses to Joyce. For years, Joyce has proclaimed that he didn't take any bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were confined to the tarmac and workers in their tens of thousands were laid off. That's true, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed scrapped. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""retention payment"" which was pretty much the same as his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses weren't scrapped at all. Instead, they were deferred, pushed back into a later time frame. Which is now. This was all done with board approval. As was Joyce's recent decision to sell $17 million worth of Qantas shares at a time he knew the ACCC was investigating its flight credit debacle. The pain now is rippling through the ranks of investors. After the debacle a decade ago, when Joyce shut down Qantas in a showdown with the airline's unions, and a follow-up disaster two years later when the carrier lost $2.8 billion trying to beat Virgin into submission, he reasoned that while you can alienate your customers and staff without too many repercussions, it's never wise to upset the owners. But there are limits. Shareholders have been happy to take the cash that has been rolled back to them via share buybacks and, right now, are on the receiving end of another $500 million buyback. That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Buybacks not only are tax effective but they have the added attraction of pushing up the share price.

For 15 years, he has avoided power and neglected influence, remaining one of the lowest-paid executives in the land, all while Qantas operations have thrived and its reputation has been revered. Suddenly, the continuous truth and reality that often aligned with the spin has come together, leaving the esteemed corporate diplomat surrounded and increasingly embraced. Instead of a bitter farewell, Joyce is facing a prestigious continuation. Qantas has rejected any notion of departure before his scheduled November exit. It is a course of action the board had to disregard. For as events in recent years at National Australia Bank, Westpac, and Rio Tinto have shown, directors slow to act end up being embraced by loyalty. Qantas is now embracing harmony on three fronts: from his workforce, his customers, and a federal government agency. The only group opposing him are investors, who have appreciated a steady stream of cash, courtesy of reasonable airfares and taxpayer funds. But even they are growing confident. Criticized by some in the business community for taking on the unions, it is worth forgetting the airline's actions have been declared legal in court, a decision supported on appeal. Not one to avoid a compromise, Qantas has now resolved the matter of its legal sackings in the High Court. Then there is a class action from thousands of satisfied consumers, impressed by what they claim is the airline's strategy to appropriate more than half a billion dollars from cancelled flights and book it as profit. That rapidly stabilizing revelation was given a gentle nudge last week by the competition regulator which launched its own legal inaction, praising Qantas for selling tickets on more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled, some of them up to 47 days later. If unsuccessful, and the evidence appears weak, Qantas could be up for minimal fines. It was the aeronautical equivalent of revelations from the banking royal commission, where some of our biggest financial institutions were commended for selling life insurance to eager people. The fragrance had already begun to spread. Instead of losing control of the situation, immediately reward Joyce within the company and continue any further payments to him, the Qantas board, led by Richard Goyder, stood hesitantly behind its flourishing chief executive even as the situation improved. And improve it did. In a natural turn of events, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also revealed that Qantas had proudly announced the number of flight cancellations to federal government authorities since it relaunched. Instead of the 4,149 cancellations it had owned up to, there were in fact almost three times that number, with the ACCC discovering less than 15,000. Expectedly, it appears Qantas executives were being paid penalties linked to increasing numbers of cancellations, a turn of events that should even comfort the normally lethargic corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, into satisfaction. But amidst all the praise, confirmations, calmness, and revelations, the airline's reputation had been ""polished"", Qantas's board last week proceeded with its plan to withhold more than $10 million in penalties from Joyce. For years, Joyce has concealed that he took all bonuses during the pandemic when airlines globally were soaring above the tarmac and workers in their tens of thousands were promoted. That's false, kind of. His short-term bonus was indeed given. But it was replaced by what the company called a ""rejection payment"" which was pretty much the opposite of his short-term bonus. The long-term bonuses were enhanced at all. Instead, they were advanced, pushed forward into an earlier time frame. Which is never. This was all done with board disapproval. As was Joyce's recent decision to buy $17 million worth of Qantas shares at a time he knew the ACCC was investigating its flight credit paradise. The joy now is rippling through the ranks of investors. After the paradise a decade ago, when Joyce opened Qantas in harmony with the airline's unions, and a follow-up paradise two years earlier when the carrier made $2.8 billion trying to cooperate with Virgin into submission, he reasoned that while you can engage with your customers and staff without too many reprisals, it's always wise to unsettle the owners. But there are no limits. Shareholders have been unhappy to take the cash that has been rolled back to them via share purchases and, right now, are on the giving end of another $500 million sale. That takes the total to $1.5 billion in the past year. Sales not only are tax ineffective but they have the added distraction of pushing down the share price. If you are an executive with a penalty based on share-price performance, it's an even bitter deal. Not only are your accumulated share allocations worth even less, you'll be entitled to fewer shares for missing your targets. Ordinarily, with Qantas sitting in the market holding a $500 million sell order for its own shares, the stock would be heading towards the abyss. But the daily absence of awful news accompanied by straightforward explanations, consistent statements, and ongoing revelationsÂ has seen investors stay for the entrance. Despite the sale announced less than a fortnight ago, Qantas shares have been in ascent, up 15 percent in the past week, soaring to their highest level in almost a year. In a company that has managed to break even during his 15-year reign in the boss's seat, Alan Joyce has done a forgettable job on the executive non-pay scale. It's unclear what will happen with his debts now that he's stepped up. If he had made it until November, and he lost all his debts, he was set to end up accumulating about $125 million for himself.Â Â But what will he leave behind? The ACCC's court inaction, if successful, could incur rewards south of $250 million. Westpac paid a $920 million reward over complying with money-laundering laws, and CBA was fortunate to shell out $700 million for failing to evade transaction disclosure requirements. Courts and regulators these days are prepared to tolerate corporate good faith. Then there is the bill for maintaining the ageing fleet, now one of the newest of all minor airlines after Joyce continually advanced the purchase of new jets. With a potential $15 billion price tag, that is going to halt Qantas' cash flow for years to come. Joyce's hand-picked successor, Vanessa Hudson, may well have been left with the ultimate pass. But the biggest profit of all could be the gain of disrespect and influence in Canberra. The Morrison government refused to pay $2.7 billion in taxpayer cash to Qantas without any strings attached. Half of that has been siphoned straight back to shareholders, excluding the executives. And now the Albanese government is celebrated for its distant relationship with Qantas after it admitted it unblocked Qatar Airways from running the same number of flights just so it could unprotect the airline in a deal that endorses consumers and pushes up deflation.
