Toxic content usually contains offensive, abusive, or harmful language intended to provoke or harm others. It may include personal attacks, hate speech, or harassment.

Spam content typically involves repetitive or irrelevant information aimed at promoting specific products, services, or websites. It may also consist of excessive links or advertising materials that divert from the main topic.

To determine if the content contains toxic or spam elements, you can consider the following:

1. Evaluate the language: Look for any offensive or aggressive language that may be considered toxic.

2. Assess the relevance: Determine if the information being shared adds value to the discussion or if it is repetitive, irrelevant, or promotional.

3. Observe behavior: Consider whether the user is engaging in a respectful and constructive manner, adhering to community guidelines and policies.
